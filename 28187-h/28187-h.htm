<h2>THE WANDERINGS AND<br />
HOMES OF MANUSCRIPTS</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Wanderings and Homes of Manuscripts is
the title of this book. To have called it the survival
and transmission of ancient literature would
have been pretentious, but not wholly untruthful.
Manuscripts, we all know, are the chief means by
which the records and imaginings of twenty centuries
have been preserved. It is my purpose to
tell where manuscripts were made, and how and
in what centres they have been collected, and,
incidentally, to suggest some helps for tracing out
their history. Naturally the few pages into which
the story has to be packed will not give room
for any one episode to be treated exhaustively.
Enough if I succeed in rousing curiosity and
setting some student to work in a field in which
an immense amount still remains to be discovered.</div>

<p>In treating of so large a subject as this&mdash;for it
is a large one&mdash;it is not a bad plan to begin with
the particular and get gradually to the general.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Some Specimen Pedigrees of MSS.</span></h3>

<p>I take my stand before the moderate-sized
bookcase which contains the collection of MSS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><a href="images/4.png">[4]</a></span>
belonging to the College of Eton, and with due care
draw from the shelves a few of the books which
have reposed there since the room was built in 1729.</p>

<p>The first shelf I lay hands upon contains some ten
large folios. Four of them are a single great compilation,
beginning with a survey of the history of
the world and of the Roman Empire, and merging
into the heraldry of the German <i>noblesse</i>. It was
made, we find, in 1541, and is dedicated to Henry
VIII. Large folding pictures on vellum and
portraits of all the Roman Emperors adorn the
first volume. It is a sumptuous book, supposed
to be a present from the Emperor Ferdinand to
the King. How did it come here? A printed
label tells us that it was given to the college by
Henry Temple, Viscount Palmerston, in 1750
(he had previously given it to Sir Richard Ellys
on whose death Lady Ellys returned it: so much in
parenthesis). Then, more by luck than anything
else, I find mention of it in the diary of Thomas
Hearne, the Oxford antiquary; his friend Thomas
Jett, F.R.S., owned it and told him about it in
1722: he had been offered &pound;100 a volume for it;
it was his by purchase from one Mr. Stebbing.
It was sold, perhaps to Palmerston, at Jett's auction
in 1731. The gap between Henry VIII. and
Stebbing remains for the present unfilled. So
much for the first draw.</p>

<p>Next, a yet larger and more ponderous volume,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><a href="images/5.png">[5]</a></span>
<i>Decreta Romanorum Pontificum</i>&mdash;the Papal decretals
and the Acts of the Councils. It is spotlessly
clean and magnificently written in a hand of the
early part of the twelfth century, a hand which
very much resembles that in use at Christchurch,
Canterbury. I am indeed, tempted to call it a
Canterbury book; only it bears none of the marks
which it ought to have if it was ever in the library
of the Cathedral Priory. Was it perhaps written
there and sold or given to a daughter-house, or to
some abbey which had a less skilful school of
writers? Not to Rochester, at any rate, though
Rochester did get many books written at Christchurch.
If it had belonged to Rochester there
would have been some trace, I think, of an inscription
on the lower margin of the first leaf. No;
the only clue to the history is a title written on the
fly-leaf in the fifteenth century, which says: "The
book of the decrees of the Pope of Rome," and it
begins on the second leaf "<i>tes viii</i>." That does not
tell us much; I do not recognize the handwriting
of the title, though I guess it to have been written
when the book came to Eton College. All I can
say is that here is an example of a large class,
duplicates of indispensable and common works,
which the abbey libraries possessed in great numbers,
and often parted with, in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, to colleges and private purchasers.</p>

<p>Next we take out a thin folio written on paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><a href="images/6.png">[6]</a></span>
This time it is a Greek book which we open; it has
the works of the Christian apologists Athenagoras
and Tatian, and a spurious epistle of Justin Martyr,
copied in 1534 by Valeriano of Forl&iacute;. A single
MS. now at Paris, written in 914, is the ancestor
of all our copies of these texts; but it has been shown
that this Eton book is not an immediate copy of
that, but of one now at Bologna. Obviously it
was written in Italy. How does it come to be here?
Sir Henry Wotton, Provost of the college, spent
the best part of twenty years in Italy, mainly as
Ambassador to the Court of Venice for James I.,
and left all his MSS. to the college at his death in
1639. There are numbers of MSS. from Italy in
this bookcase, and, though hardly any of them have
Wotton's name in them, it is not to be doubted
that they came from him. A good proportion of
them, too, can be traced back a step farther, for
they have in them the name or the arms or the
handwriting of Bernardo Bembo of Venice, the
father of the more famous Cardinal Pietro Bembo.
This Justin volume is not of that number, but
we have a clue to its history which may be deemed
sufficient.</p>

<p>I turn to another shelf and open a large book
written somewhere about the year 1150, which was
given to the college in 1713 by one of the Fellows;
in 1594 it belonged to John Rogers (if I read the
name right). It contains St. Jerome's Commentary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><a href="images/7.png">[7]</a></span>
on Daniel and the Minor Prophets, followed by a
tract of St. Ambrose, and another ascribed to
Jerome (subject, the hardening of Pharaoh's
heart), which was in reality, we are now told, written
by a Pelagian. It is a very uncommon text. After
that we have Jerome's (so-called) prophecy of the
fifteen signs which are to precede the last judgment&mdash;of
which signs, let it be said in passing, there is a
fine representation in an ancient window in the
Church of All Saints, North Street, at York. Can
we trace this volume any farther back than 1594?
I think so; the Ambrose and the two spurious
tracts of Jerome (one, as I said, being of very rare
occurrence) are entered, in that order, in the
catalogue of the library of Peterborough Abbey.
The library has long been dispersed, but the catalogue
remains, and was printed by Gunton in his
History of the Abbey. But the said catalogue
makes no mention of the Commentary of Jerome,
which fills 323 out of the 358 leaves of our book.
A serious obstacle, it will be said, to an identification;
yet a long series of observations, too long
to be set out here, has led me to the conclusion
that our Peterborough catalogue makes a practice
of not entering the main contents of the volumes,
but only the short subsidiary tracts, which might
else escape notice. And without much hesitation
I put down the book before me as a relic of the
Peterborough Library.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><a href="images/8.png">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat higher up stands a very stout book
bound in old patterned paper. The material of
it is paper too, the language is Greek, and the
contents, for the most part, Canons of Councils.
There are two hands in it; one is perhaps of the
fourteenth century, the other is of the early part
of the fifteenth. This latter is the writing of one
Michael Doukas, who tells us that he was employed
as a scribe by Brother John of Ragusa, who held
some position at a Church Council, unnamed.
There were two Johns of Ragusa, it seems, both
Dominicans, one of whom figured at the Council
of Constance in 1413, the other at that of Basle
in 1433. The latter must be the right one, for
there are still Greek MSS. at Basle which belonged
to the Dominicans of that city, and were bequeathed
by the second John at his death in 1442.</p>

<p>The book is important, because the first thing
in it is the only copy of a treatise ascribed to St.
Athanasius, called a Synopsis of Holy Scripture.
This treatise was printed first in 1600 by an editor
named Felckmann, and no MS. of it has been used
or known since. Where did Felckmann find it?
In a MS. which belonged to Pierre Nevelet, procured
for him (the editor) by Bongars, a distinguished
scholar of Orleans. Now, the Eton book
has in it a whole series of names of owners, some
erased, but decipherable. The earliest seems to be
Joannes Gastius, who in 1550 gave it to Johannes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><a href="images/9.png">[9]</a></span>
Hernogius (as I doubtfully read it). Then come
Petrus Neveletus and his son, I(saac) N(icolas)
Neveletus. Evidently, then, we have here the
MS. which Felckmann used, and we arrive at
some date after 1600. In 1665 or 1685 Daniel
Mauclerc, Doctor of Law, living at Vitry le
Fran&ccedil;ois, is the owner. He leaves France (the
family were Huguenots), and brings the book to
Holland. His son Jacques, Doctor of Medicine,
has it in 1700, in England; his nephew, John Henry
Mauclerc, also M.D., succeeds to it and enters his
name in 1748, and gives it to Mr. Roger Huggett,
Conduct and Librarian of the College, who died in
1769.</p>

<p>This is an unusually full and clear pedigree.
One more, and I have done.</p>

<p>This time it is a copy of the Polychronicon of
Ranulph Higden, monk of Chester; it was the
popular history of the world and of England for
anyone who could read Latin in the fifteenth century.
No abbey library could be without it, just
as no gentleman's library could be without a copy
of the English Chronicle called the Brut. Here is a
case in which we know the beginning and end of
the book's wanderings, but not the middle of the
story. The arms of Eton adorn the beginning of
each of the seven "books" of the Chronicle, so
we may take it that it was owned from the first by
a member of the foundation. An inscription tells us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><a href="images/10.png">[10]</a></span>
that within the fifteenth century it belonged to the
Carthusians of Witham in Somerset, and was given
to them by Master John Blacman. Here is light.
John Blacman was Fellow and Chanter of Eton,
then Head of a House (King's Hall) in Cambridge,
and lastly a Carthusian monk. He was also confessor
to Henry VI., and wrote a book about him.
In a MS. at Oxford there is a list of the books he
gave to Witham, and among them is this Polychronicon.
More: he has prefixed to the text a
pedigree of the Kings of England from Egbert,
illustrated with drawings, the last of which is the
earliest known representation of Windsor Castle.
We have not, then, to complain of lack of information
about the early stages of the history; but
then comes a gap, and between the Dissolution and
the early part of the nineteenth century, when
Rodd of London had it and sold it to the fourth
Earl of Ashburnham, I can (at present) hear nothing
of the book. In quite recent years it passed from
the Ashburnham family to Mr. H. Y. Thompson,
from him to Mr. George Dunn, and at his death
was bought back for its first home.</p>

<p>There, then, are half a dozen histories of MSS.,
fairly typical and fairly diverse. Naturally I have
picked out books which have some traceable story.
Very many have none. We can only say of them
that they were written in such a century and such
a country, and acquired at such a date: and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><a href="images/11.png">[11]</a></span>
an end. Rebinding and loss of leaves, especially
of fly-leaves, have carried off names of owners and
library-marks, and apart from that there are but
very few cases in which we are warranted in proclaiming
from the aspect and character of the script
that a book was written at one particular place
and nowhere else.</p>

<p>I think it will be seen, from what has been said,
that my subject is one which depends for its actuality
upon the accumulation of a great number of small
facts. There is, of course, a broad historical background:
no less than the whole history of Western
Europe since the period of the Barbarian invasions.
That cannot be looked for here, of course; but there
are certain <i>data</i> of capital importance which cannot
be spared, and some plotting out of the whole field
is indispensable.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>The Limits of the Subject</span></h3>

<p>Greek and Latin MSS. are the main subject.
Oriental books we do not even touch upon, and
vernacular books in English or French have to
take a secondary place; and we may treat first
of the Greek, for it is by far the most compact
division. In the case of both Greek and Latin
books we shall ask where and when they were chiefly
made, when and how they left their early homes,
and where they are to be found now.</p>

<p>We shall rule out the whole of what may be called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><a href="images/12.png">[12]</a></span>
the classical period&mdash;the libraries of Alexandria
and Pergamon, the bookshops of Martial's time&mdash;yes,
and even the fourth-century library of C&aelig;sarea&mdash;for
of these we have no relics. Our concern
is with what exists to-day, or what did exist until
the nation, which has contributed so largely to
learning and history in the past, turned apostate,
and to its lasting shame destroyed and dispersed
what more ignorant men had spared. The mischief
Germany has done&mdash;and it will be long before we
learn the full extent of it&mdash;she has done with open
eyes.</p>

<p>We think primarily of Belgium and North-Eastern
France as the scenes of her worst devastations,
but she has not confined her work of spoliation
to them. The Balkan provinces and Russia
held great masses of Greek and Slavonic MSS. as yet
very incompletely known. The actual invasions
of German troops, and the wars and revolutions
which Germany has fostered in those regions, can
hardly have been less mischievous than her operations
in the West.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Greek MSS.: Production and Dispersion</span></h3>

<p>The area in which Greek MSS. were produced
in the medieval period was (with negligible exceptions)
confined to Greece proper, "Turkey in
Europe," the Levant, and South Italy. In the
monastic centres, particularly Mount Athos, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><a href="images/13.png">[13]</a></span>
were and are large stores of Greek books, the vast
majority of which are theological or liturgical;
and the theological authors most in vogue are those
of the fourth and later centuries. Copies of primitive
Christian authors or classical ones are comparative
rarities. True, one or two of surpassing
interest have been found in such libraries; a famous
Plato was brought by Dr. E. D. Clarke from Patmos,
and is at Oxford now; the treatise of Hippolytus
against heresies came in the forties from a monastery
to the Paris library. But these are exceptions.
We have to look at Constantinople as by far the most
important centre of learning and of book-production.
The city was full of libraries, public and private,
and of readers. The culture of the place was, no
doubt, self-contained; it did not aim at enriching
the outer world, which it despised; its literary productions
were imitative, the work of <i>dilettanti</i>
and decadents. Nevertheless, it preserved for us
wellnigh all that we now have of the best literature
of Greece, and, but for a few catastrophes, it would
have handed on much more. Of thirty-two historical
writings read and excerpted by Photius in
his <i>Bibliotheca</i>, late in the ninth century, nineteen
are lost; of several of the Attic orators, Lysias,
Lycurgus, Hyperides, Dinarchus, he possessed
many more speeches than we have seen. Michael
Psellus, who died about 1084, is credited (I must
allow that the evidence is not of the best) with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><a href="images/14.png">[14]</a></span>
writing notes on twenty-four comedies of Menander,
of which, as is well known, we have not one complete.
In the twelfth century John Tzetzes and
Eustathius apparently had access still to very
many lost authors. In short, before the Latin
occupation of Constantinople in 1204, the remains
of ancient Greek literature very notably exceeded
their present bulk. Much of it, no doubt, was
preserved in single copies, and only a narrow
selection of authors was in constant use for educational
purposes. Only three plays out of seven
of &AElig;schylus, for example, were read in the schools.
The rest, with Sophocles and Apollonius Rhodius,
practically depended for their survival on the famous
copy now at Florence. Instances might be multiplied.
The threads of transmission to which we
owe most of the Euripidean plays, the Anthology,
the History of Polybius, the works of Clement of
Alexandria, the Christian Apologists, the commentary
of Origen upon St. John, are equally slender.
We cannot doubt that the sack of Constantinople
by the Crusaders was, in its obliteration of works
of art and of literature, far more disastrous than the
capture of the city by the Turks in 1453. For the
best part of a century before the latter date, the
export of precious MSS. to Italy had been going
on, and many of our greatest treasures were already
safe in the hands of scholars when the crash came.
Nor is it possible, I believe, to show that between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><a href="images/15.png">[15]</a></span>
1204 and 1453 many authors whose works no longer
exist were read in Byzantine circles. That there
was destruction of books in 1453 is no doubt true;
but within a very few years the Turks had learned
that money was to be made of them, and the sale
and export went on at a great rate.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>European Centres for Greek MSS.: Continental</span></h3>

<p>Thus the drafting of Greek MSS. into the libraries
of Western Europe has been a long and gradual
process. Many of the best, that were secured by
individual scholars such as Giannozzo Manetti,
Aurispa, and Niccolo Niccoli, found their way into
the Laurentian Library at Florence; others, collected
by Nicholas V. (d. 1455), are the nucleus
of the Vatican collection; a third set was the gift
of the Greek Cardinal Bessarion (d. 1468) to Venice.
But probably in quality, and certainly in quantity,
the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris excels even
the Italian storehouses of Greek MSS. The premier
Greek MS. of France is a copy of the works attributed
to Dionysius the Areopagite, which the
Greek Emperor Michael the Stammerer sent to
Louis the Pious in the year 827. It was long at
the Royal Abbey of St. Denis, but strayed away
somehow; then, bought by Henri de Mesmes in
the sixteenth century, it came into the Royal
Library in 1706, and has been there ever since.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><a href="images/16.png">[16]</a></span>
Its present number is Bib. Nat. Grec 437. Another
treasure of ancient times which was once at St.
Denis is the sixth-century uncial Greek MS. of the
Prophets known as Codex Marchalianus, now in
the Vatican; but when it came to France is not
clearly made out. Coming to later times, the not
inconsiderable collection made by Francis I.
received a notable increase in that of Catherine
de' Medici, once the property of Cardinal Ridolfi,
and the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. were for it
an epoch of rapid growth. Between 1645 and
1740 the number of volumes swelled from 1,255
to 3,197. The Revolution period added the collection
of Coislin, or rather of S&eacute;guier&mdash;400 more.
At the present day Paris must possess 5,000 Greek
MSS.</p>

<p>In Central Europe Vienna may be reckoned the
chief repository. It contains the remarkable collection
of the traveller Augier de Busbecq, made
in the East about 1570, which was once at Augsburg.
Spain&mdash;I think principally of the Escurial Library&mdash;has
suffered from depredation and from fire, and
is poorer than the prominence of its early contributions
to the cause of learning deserves.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Greek MSS. in England</span></h3>

<p>It is a temptation, when one turns to England,
to enlarge upon the early history of Greek scholarship
in the country, but it is a temptation which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><a href="images/17.png">[17]</a></span>
must be resisted. We had a share in preparing for
the revival of learning. Roger Bacon and Grosseteste
(I say nothing of the earlier age, of Theodore
of Tarsus and Bede) were men whose work in this
direction has hardly met with full appreciation
as yet; and later on we gave Erasmus a welcome
and a home. But we did not rival Italy or France
in the early scramble for Greek books. Such
classical MSS. of first-class value as we possess
have been importations of the seventeenth and
later centuries. Let me, however, speak somewhat
more in detail.</p>

<p>There was a turbulent person called George
Neville, who died Archbishop of York in 1476.
It is evident, though not, I think, from anything
that he wrote, that he was interested in Greek
learning, and not only theological learning. A
MS. of some orations of Demosthenes now at Leyden
contains a statement by the scribe that he wrote
it for Archbishop Neville in 1472. This is our
starting-point. Now, the scribe in question&mdash;Emmanuel
of Constantinople&mdash;generally writes
a hand (ugly enough) which no one who has once
seen it can fail to recognize. This hand appears
in a not inconsiderable group of books: in a Plato
and an Aristotle now at Durham, in a Suidas
given by the Chapter of Durham to Lord Oxford
(Brit. Mus., MS., Harl. 3,100), in a rather famous
New Testament at Leicester, in three Psalters at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><a href="images/18.png">[18]</a></span>
Oxford and Cambridge, and in half of another
copy of Suidas at Oxford. In this second Suidas
Emmanuel's hand is associated with another,
equally easy to recognize&mdash;that of Joannes Serbopoulos.
Serbopoulos lived, I know not how long,
in the abbey at Reading, and transcribed several
Greek MSS. now in Oxford and Cambridge libraries;
he was still at work in the first years of the sixteenth
century. This little episode is one that demonstrates,
in a rather pleasing way, the value of the
study of handwritings and of the inscriptions
written by scribes; the light it throws on the history
of scholarship is unexpected, and is worth having.</p>

<p>Two Biblical MSS. of high importance came to
England as gifts to our Sovereigns. One was the
well-known Codex Alexandrinus (A), given to
Charles I. in 1628 by Cyril Lucar, the reforming
Patriarch of Constantinople. Of the other I shall
take leave to say more. It was that known as the
Cottonian Genesis, which was brought over by
two Greek Bishops "from Philippi" and presented
to Henry VIII. It was a sixth-century copy of the
Book of Genesis, written in uncial letters and illustrated,
we are told, with 250 pictures. Queen
Elizabeth passed it on to her tutor, Sir John
Fortescue, and he to Sir Robert Cotton, the
collector of a library of which we shall hear
more in the sequel, and in that library it remained
(when not out on loan) till Saturday,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><a href="images/19.png">[19]</a></span>
October 23, 1731. On that day a fire broke
out in Ashburnham House in Westminster (where
the Cotton and Royal Libraries were then kept),
and the bookcase in which the Genesis was
suffered horribly. The Cotton MSS.&mdash;for I may
as well explain this matter now as later&mdash;were
kept in presses, each of which had a bust of a Roman
Emperor on the top. They ran from Julius to
Domitian, and were supplemented by Cleopatra
and Faustina. Augustus and Domitian had but
one shelf each (Augustus contained charters,
drawings, and the like; Domitian was originally,
perhaps, a small case over a doorway); the others
had usually six shelves, lettered from A to F,
and the books in each shelf were numbered from
i. onwards in Roman figures. The Genesis was
Otho, B vi., and the three presses of Galba, Otho,
and Vitellius were those in which the fire did most
mischief. No complete leaf is left of Genesis;
there are bits of blackened text and pictures, a
few of which strayed to the library of the Baptist
College at Bristol. The text had been examined
by competent scholars for editions of the Greek
Old Testament, and we are able to judge of its
value; but of the pictures, alas! no list or description
had been made. Still, something is known.
An eminent French polymath, the Sieur de Peiresc
(whose life by P. Gassendi is well worth reading),
borrowed the book from Cotton, and had careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><a href="images/20.png">[20]</a></span>
copies of one or two of the illustrations made for
him, and these exist. And a further interesting
fact has come out: by the help of our scanty relics
a student of art, Professor Tikkanen, of Helsingfors,
in Finland, was able to show that the designers of
a long series of mosaic pictures from Genesis in
St. Mark's at Venice must have had before them
either the Cotton Genesis or its twin sister, so closely
do the mosaics follow the compositions in the MS.</p>

<p>In somewhat similar fashion, by gift from the
reformer Theodore de B&eacute;ze, the University of
Cambridge acquired its greatest Greek treasure,
the Codex Bez&aelig; (D) of the Gospels and Acts in
Elizabeth's reign. The riddles which its text
presents have exercised many brains, and I do not
know who would allow that they are finally solved.
Another famous MS., the unique Lexicon of Photius,
was acquired by Thomas Gale, Dean of York,
early in the eighteenth century&mdash;one would like
to know where. To my eye it bears signs of having
been long in Western Europe, if not in England.
Roger Gale gave it, with his own and his father's
other MSS., to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1738.
On the whole, however, Cambridge has not been
nearly so fortunate as Oxford in accumulating
Greek books. Oxford had a magnificent present
in 1629 from its Chancellor, the Earl of Pembroke,
of 240 MSS. purchased in block from the Venetian
Barocci, and in 1817 made a great and wise purchase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><a href="images/21.png">[21]</a></span>
of 128 more, contained in the collection of
another Venetian, the Abate Canonici. In the
interval such diverse benefactors as Laud and
Cromwell had enriched it with some very notable
gifts. The pedigree of one of Laud's MSS. may be
familiar, but is too illuminating to be omitted. It
is a seventh-century copy of the Acts of the Apostles
in Greek and Latin. The earliest home to which
we can trace it is Sardinia; a document connected
with that island is written on a fly-leaf. Then
we find indisputable evidence that Bede, writing
early in the eighth century, had access to it;
he quotes in his <i>Retractations</i> on the Acts readings
which are characteristic of it; and as he never left
his monastery in the North, we may be sure that
the book was at Jarrow or Wearmouth in his
time. After that it disappears until Laud buys
it. Like many of his books, it came to him from
Germany, a spoil of the Thirty Years' War. These
various <i>data</i> are best linked up if we suppose (1)
that the MS. was brought from Italy to England
by Theodore of Tarsus or his companion Abbot
Hadrian in 668; (2) that it was taken from England
to Germany after Bede's death by one of the companions
of St. Boniface, the apostle of that country,
and remained there, in or near Fulda, perhaps,
until the convulsion which threw it back upon
our shores.</p>

<p>Take another illustration. When John Leland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><a href="images/22.png">[22]</a></span>
in Henry VIII.'s reign, visited the library of Canterbury
Cathedral, he saw there part of the Old Testament
in Greek&mdash;chiefly the poetical books and
the Psalter. He does not mention the Pentateuch.
Nevertheless, it can be shown that that was also
there, for among the Canonici MSS. in the Bodleian
is one of the thirteenth century containing Genesis
to Ruth in Greek, which has on a margin the inscription,
legible though erased: "liber ecclesie
Christi Cantuarie." How it left England at the
Dissolution one may guess easily enough, but what
its fortunes were before it came to light again at
Venice I believe there is nothing to show.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Speaking broadly, then, of the destinies of Greek
MSS., I may repeat that they were produced in a
comparatively small area, that a great many of
the most precious ones were concentrated in one
place, and that from the fourteenth century onwards
they became objects of desire to the great ones of
the earth, who vied with each other in sending
special emissaries to collect them. As a result,
the greatest treasures were soon locked up in the
libraries of princes and prelates, and became less
commonly exposed to dispersion and sale than
Latin books. We must remember, too, that as a
rule the monasteries of Western Europe did not
collect Greek MSS.; they possessed a chance one
here and there, as we have seen, but rather as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><a href="images/23.png">[23]</a></span>
curiosities than as books to be used.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> To the noble
and the scholar there was a flavour of distinction
about a Greek MS. which was wanting to all but
the most venerable and beautiful of the Latin ones.</p>

<p>There is still much to be done in the investigation
of the history and relationships of Greek MSS.
In spite of the numberless editions of the great
authors, and the labour that has been lavished
upon them, I believe that scholars would agree
that in very few cases, if any, is the transmission
of the text at all perfectly known. For some
writings we have too little MS. evidence, for some
so much as to be embarrassing. In no case can
we afford to neglect and to leave unrecorded anything
that a MS. can tell us as to its place of origin,
its scribe, or its owners. Names and scribblings
on fly-leaves, which to one student suggest nothing,
may combine in the memory of another into a
coherent piece of history, and show him the home
of the book at a particular date, and by consequence
unveil a whole section of the story of its wanderings.
With one little instance of this kind I will bring
to an end my remarks on this first and shorter
portion of my subject. In the library of Corpus
Christi College at Cambridge is a Greek Psalter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><a href="images/24.png">[24]</a></span>
written in the middle of the twelfth century. On
one of its last pages is scribbled in Greek letters
by a later hand the name of John Farley ("<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Hi&ocirc;hann&ecirc;s pharlehi">&#7993;&#969;&#7937;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#966;&#945;&#961;&#955;&#949;&#7985;</ins>"). Only about five-and-twenty volumes
away from this stands a MS. containing letters
written by the University of Oxford on public
occasions. One of these is signed by J. Farley.
A little enquiry elicits the fact that John Farley
was official scribe of that University near the
end of the fifteenth century. The Greek Psalter,
then, was pretty certainly at Oxford in Farley's
time. What do we know of Greek MSS. then at
Oxford? We know that Bishop Robert Grosseteste
of Lincoln owned such things, and that he
bequeathed his books to the Franciscans of Oxford
at his death in 1254; and when we examine the
Psalter again, we find that it is full of notes in a
hand which occurs in other Greek MSS. known to
have belonged to Grosseteste, and which I take
to be Grosseteste's autograph. So the mere
occurrence of John Farley's name helps us to write
the history of the book from within a hundred
years of its making until the present day. Procured
by Grosseteste some time before 1254, it
passes to Oxford, and remains there till the Grey
Friar's Convent is dissolved by Henry VIII. Then
there is a gap of a generation at most. Matthew
Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, acquires it
(believing it, absurdly enough, to have belonged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><a href="images/25.png">[25]</a></span>
to Archbishop Theodore in the seventh century),
and bequeaths it to his college of Corpus Christi
in 1574.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Latin MSS.</span></h3>

<p>We turn to the Latin division, and here the difficulty
of selecting lines of procedure is very great.
A paragraph of historical preface, at any rate, must
be attempted.</p>

<p>At the period of the Barbarian invasions&mdash;the
fifth century&mdash;the learned countries were Italy,
France (especially Southern France) and Spain.
Of these three, Italy may be described as stationary
or even decadent, but she possessed greater accumulations
of books than either of the other two. The
result of the invasions was, no doubt, that libraries
were destroyed and education dislocated; but
there was another result, as we have lately begun
to realize&mdash;namely, that in the case of France
there was a transplanting of culture to another
soil. A number of teachers fled the country, and
some at least came to Ireland. This, as far as we
can now see, was the beginning of that Irish learning
which has been so widely, yet so vaguely, extolled.
Ireland, then, in the late fifth century and the sixth,
holds the lamp. Its light passes to England in
the middle of the seventh century, and from thence,
near the end of the eighth, to the Court of Charlemagne,
where it initiates the Carolingian Renaissance.
In the ninth century, when England is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><a href="images/26.png">[26]</a></span>
prey to the Danes, the Carolingian Court and the
great abbeys of Germany are enjoying a vigorous
intellectual life, stimulated and enriched by scholars
from Italy and from Ireland. In a general view
the tenth and eleventh centuries must figure as a
period of degeneration; the twelfth as one of immense
intellectual and artistic vigour, culminating
in the thirteenth. In the fourteenth the foundations
of what we call the Renaissance are already
being laid, and we have hardly passed the middle
of the fifteenth before the MS. has received its death-blow
in the publication of the first printed Bible.</p>

<p>This absurdly condensed review of ten centuries
has, I believe, some truth in it, in spite of the fact
that every clause needs qualification. We shall
have to go over the same ground again a little
more slowly. At present we will devote a little
time to the beginnings of our period.</p>

<p>A few relics of the days before the Barbarian
invasion have reached us. I am not thinking
of the library of rolls found at Herculaneum in the
eighteenth century, the unrolling and decipherment
of which still goes on slowly at Naples, nor
of the many precious fragments of rolls and books
which have come in our own generation from
Egypt, but rather of those which have been preserved
above ground in libraries. Such are the
Virgils of the Vatican, of St. Gall, and of Florence.</p>

<p>Perhaps a word about these ancient Virgils will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><a href="images/27.png">[27]</a></span>
not be unwelcome. They are cited in all the textbooks,
it is true, but I think they are apt to be
confused; at any rate it is easy to confuse them.</p>

<p>They are five in number: three very fragmentary,
two more or less complete. The surnames they
go by are <i>Sangallensis</i>, <i>Augusteus</i>, <i>Vaticanus</i>,
<i>Romanus</i>, <i>Mediceus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sangallensis</i> and <i>Augusteus</i> are practically the
only pieces of books we have which are written
in the old square capitals, like those of the Roman
inscriptions. <i>Sangallensis</i> consists of a few leaves
which were found by Von Arx, a librarian of St.
Gall, in the bindings of books in that abbey's
library. Of <i>Augusteus</i> there are four leaves at
Rome (<i>Vaticanus latinus</i> 3,256) and three at
Berlin; and somewhere, perhaps in a private library
in France, is or was another bit which was known
to scholars in the seventeenth century. This
copy was once at the Royal Abbey of St. Denis.
Both of these are fourth-century books at latest.</p>

<p><i>Vaticanus</i> (<i>lat.</i> 3,225) is a more complete copy,
illustrated with fifty paintings in good classical
style, and is also assigned to the fourth century.</p>

<p><i>Romanus</i> (<i>Vat. lat.</i> 3,867), once at St. Denis, is a
pictured copy too, but not nearly so good in style.</p>

<p><i>Mediceus</i>, written before <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 494, is at Florence
(a single leaf of it is bound up with <i>Vaticanus</i>).
It was formerly in the abbey library of Bobbio.</p>

<p>These three books are written in "rustic capitals."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><a href="images/28.png">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A larger, but still small, group of books of "classical"
date are the palimpsests, the most famous
of which are at Milan and Rome. There was a
time, early in the nineteenth century, when Angelo
Mai, afterwards Cardinal, and Prefect of the Vatican
Library, was constantly launching fresh surprises
upon scholars, the results of his work in what was
then an almost untouched field. Large fragments
of Cicero's <i>Republic</i>, of lost orations of Cicero,
of the works of the rhetorician Fronto, were issued
at short intervals: and all the most important
of these were recovered from palimpsests in the
Ambrosian or the Vatican Library. They had all
come, too, from one place, the same Bobbio which
has been already named. Bobbio was founded by
the Irishman St. Columban (d. 615). The list of
the early and valuable MSS. which can be traced
to it would take up a large share of my available
space; but among the precious things it owned
was a number of quite ancient volumes, the Cicero
and Fronto and others&mdash;books sumptuously written
in uncial letters in the fourth century, which, sad
to say, the Bobbio monks themselves broke up,
washed out the earlier writing, and covered the
pages with texts more immediately useful to them.
Whence did they come? An answer to that
question has been offered recently which finds
favour among experts. They are the relics, it
is said, of the library formed by Cassiodorus at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><a href="images/29.png">[29]</a></span>
monastery of Vivarium or Squillace, in South Italy.
Cassiodorus is a great figure in the history of his
own time, and in his influence upon the general
course of learning. He was private secretary to
Theodoric King of the Goths; in his old age he
retired from public to monastic life, and his last
years were devoted to equipping the monks he had
gathered about him for study&mdash;first and foremost
the study of the Scriptures, but also, as leading up
to that, the study of languages, of history and
geography, and, as conducing to the general welfare,
of medicine, botany, and other useful arts.
It had been a cherished project of his to found an
academy at Rome where all such learning might
be fostered, but that plan failed, and Cassiodorus
took into his retreat at Vivarium all the store of
books he had accumulated, and wrote a little manual
to guide his monks to the right use of them. His
<i>Institutes</i> (as the book is called) do not give a set
catalogue of his library, but there are many and
striking coincidences between the manual and the
literary works which can be traced to Bobbio.
A specimen may be given: he recommends a writer
on gardening called Gargilius Martialis. Hardly
anyone else mentions this person, and his work
had disappeared until Mai found pieces of it in a
palimpsest at Naples which had come from Bobbio.
We owe much to Cassiodorus in any case, for it
was he who commended secular learning to monks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><a href="images/30.png">[30]</a></span>
and the fact that monks were the great preservers
of ancient literature cannot be dissociated from his
influence. I shall be glad if the theory I have
stated (it is that of the late Dr. Rudolf Beer) proves
sound; to have some of the very volumes which
Cassiodorus handled would be worth much.</p>

<p>There is a link between the library of Cassiodorus
and our own country. A famous Latin Bible now
at Florence, the <i>Codex Amiatinus</i>, is known to have
been once in England, at Wearmouth or Jarrow,
and to have been taken abroad by Ceolfrid, Abbot
of those monasteries, in 716 as a present to the
Pope, whom it never reached, for Ceolfrid died at
Langres on his way to Rome. The story has often
been told, and needs not to be dwelt upon here;
but a view has been broached, and is stoutly maintained
by Sir Henry Howorth, which does deserve
mention and is not yet familiar. It is that the
first quire in the Amiatine Bible, which contains
pictures and lists of Biblical books, is actually a
portion of a Bible written for Cassiodorus. There
is much to be said for this, and at the least we may
be sure that it is a direct copy from such a Bible.
Sir Henry would go farther, and claim the whole
book as Cassiodorian. I do not know that expert
opinion is prepared to endorse this.</p>

<p>The mention of Cassiodorus has led us below the
date of the "classical" period, for he died in 583.
For one moment I revert to the earlier time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><a href="images/31.png">[31]</a></span>
record an interesting example of wandering. Illustrated
books of the early centuries are the greatest
of rarities. The two Virgils, the Vienna and the
Cotton Genesis, the Homer at Milan, the Gospels
of Rossano in Calabria and those of Sinope now at
Paris, the Dioscorides at Vienna, the Pentateuch
of Tours, the Joshua-roll at the Vatican&mdash;these
are the most famous, and there are very few beside
them. Among those few are some pieces of a Latin
Bible written in the fourth century, and containing
parts of Samuel and Kings, with paintings which,
when fresh, must have been of high excellence.
They have unhappily suffered grievous damage,
for they were used in the seventeenth century to
make covers for municipal documents at the royal
and ancient abbatial town of Quedlinburg (the
scene of Canning's <i>Rovers</i>). The painted leaves
are now at Berlin; a leaf of plain text remains at
Quedlinburg. No one doubts that the book to
which they belonged was made in Italy, and the
likeliest history that can be imagined for it is that
it was brought as a gift to the abbey by a German
prince, say in the tenth century. It is hard to
explain the neglect and mutilation of so noble a
book, in whose contents there was nothing to offend
Protestant or other religious susceptibilities. Only
we find, by numerous examples, that the MSS.
we should most prize now, those written in capitals
or uncials with the words undivided, or in Irish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><a href="images/32.png">[32]</a></span>
or English scripts which became unfamiliar, were
uniformly despised and neglected by the readers
of later centuries. We meet with notes of this
kind in monastic catalogues: "It cannot be read,"
"Old and useless," and the like. Still, one would
have thought that the pictures of the Quedlinburg
book would have saved it, even in a German nunnery.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Chronological Survey</span></h3>

<p>Since this little book is not a treatise on pal&aelig;ography,
a manual of art, or a history of learning,
and yet has to touch upon all three provinces,
it is important to keep it from straying too far into
any of them, and this is one of the most difficult
tasks that I have ever enterprised. The temptation
to dilate upon the beauty and intrinsic interest
of the MSS. and upon the characteristic scripts
of different ages and countries is hard to resist.
And, indeed, without some slight elucidation of
such matters my readers may be very much at fault.</p>

<p>I had begun a geographical survey of the field,
taking countries as the units, and had written upon
Italy and Spain, and attempted France. But
I found that when the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries were reached my tract was becoming a
disquisition upon pal&aelig;ography, art, and learning,
and, of course, was failing to do justice either to
any one of them or to what it had promised in
its title. I now think that a chronological survey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><a href="images/33.png">[33]</a></span>
will be more practicable, and that it will be best
to take first the subject of book-production, looking
at each country in turn in a single period, instead
of following the course taken by each, from the
sixth century to the fifteenth.</p>

<p><i>Sixth and Seventh Centuries.</i>&mdash;Italy, France,
and Spain are the main centres. Ireland is active
in learning, and in the second half of the seventh
century England, under Archbishop Theodore and
Abbot Hadrian, produces schools which rival the
Irish, and, in the person of Bede, has the greatest
scholar of the time. Some of the great Irish
monasteries, such as Bobbio, Luxeuil, St. Gall,
are founded on the Continent.</p>

<p>Books are produced in considerable numbers in
Italy, France, Spain; and from Italy they are
exported, especially by English pilgrims, such as
Benedict Biscop. The Gospel harmony written
in 546 by or for Bishop Victor of Capua comes
to England, and goes abroad again, with St. Boniface,
perhaps, and now rests at Fulda, where also
his body lies. A copy of St. Jerome on Ecclesiastes,
written in Italy in the sixth or seventh century,
has in it the Anglo-Saxon inscription, "The book
of Cuthsuuitha the Abbess." The only Abbess
Cuthsuuitha we know of presided over a nunnery
in or near Worcester about 690-700. Her book
travelled to Germany with some British or English
missionary, and is at W&uuml;rzburg. W&uuml;rzburg is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><a href="images/34.png">[34]</a></span>
Irish foundation; its apostle and patron, St. Kilian,
is said to have been assassinated in 689. From
Italy, too, came (most likely) the illustrated Gospels
now at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (286),
which belonged once to Christchurch, Canterbury;
and the beautiful little copy of St. John's Gospel
at Stonyhurst College, which was found in the
coffin of St. Cuthbert (d. 687) when it was opened in
1104. And St. Gall must have acquired its ancient
Virgil from Italy also&mdash;when, we do not know.</p>

<p>Spain kept her books very much to herself, one
would guess, judging from the very few Spanish
MSS. of this age which are to be met with in the
rest of Europe. The guess, however, would not
be quite correct. There was one great Spanish
scholar in the seventh century, Isidore of Seville
(636), and his encyclop&aelig;dia (The <i>Etymologies</i> or
<i>Origins</i>), which fed many later centuries with learning,
made its way all over educated Europe very
quickly. Not only so, but we find English scholars
(Aldhelm and Bede) quoting Spanish writers on
grammar and Spanish poets who were almost
their own contemporaries.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Century.</i>&mdash;This sees the last part of Bede's
career (d. 734)&mdash;the zenith of English scholarship,
the mission of St. Boniface (d. 758) to Germany,
the meeting of Alcuin with Charlemagne (781),
and the beginning of the Carolingian Renaissance.
But, on the other hand, Spain is overrun by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><a href="images/35.png">[35]</a></span>
Moors, Italy is inert, England begins to be harried
by the Northmen. On the whole, if there really
was a Dark Age, the middle of the eighth century
seems to answer the description best. But, of
course, there were points of light. The great
centres of Northern France, such as Corbie and
Laon, particularly Corbie, were beginning their
activities of collecting and copying books. Ireland
was capable of producing such a work as the Book
of Kells&mdash;whether it actually falls within the century
or not I will not be positive, but work of the
same amazing beauty was carried out before 800.
Nor was the export of treasures from Italy to England
quite stopped, in spite of difficulties. At the
Plantin Museum at Antwerp is a copy of the writings
of the Christian poet Sedulius, which has pictures
of the old Italian sort, such as we find in the frescoes
of the Roman catacombs. In it is a note connecting
it with a Bishop of the name of Cuthwin, who
held the East Anglian see and died about 754.
Another MS., at Paris, has a note describing an
elaborately illustrated life of St. Paul, which, it
says, the same Bishop Cuthwin brought with him
from Rome.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Century.</i>&mdash;There is immense activity,
literary and artistic, afoot at the Court of Charlemagne
(d. 814) and of his successors. The German
abbeys&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Lorsch, Fulda&mdash;and cathedral schools
(Mainz, Bamberg, etc.) are full of scribes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><a href="images/36.png">[36]</a></span>
teachers. Irishmen who know Greek flock to the
Continent, driven from home by Danish invasion:
such are Johannes Scottus Eriugena and Sedulius
Scottus. They haunt Li&eacute;ge, Laon, Aix-la-Chapelle,
and penetrate to Italy. Not less prolific are the
French houses: at Tours the handwriting called
the Carolingian minuscule, the parent of our modern
"Roman" printing, is developed, though not at
Tours alone. At Corbie, Fleury on the Loire,
(now called St. B&eacute;noit sur Loire), St. Riquier by
Abbeville, Rheims, and many another centre in
Northern and Eastern France, libraries are accumulated
and ancient books copied. Of St. Gall and
Reichenau the same may be said. In Italy, Verona
is conspicuous. The archdeacon Pacificus (d. 846)
gave over 200 books to the cathedral, where many
of them still are; and at Monte Cassino, the head
house of the Benedictine Order, books were written
in the difficult "Beneventane" hand (which used
to be called Lombardic, and was never popular
outside Italy). Spain has its own special script
at this time, the Visigothic, as troublesome to read
as the Beneventane; its <i>a</i>'s are like <i>u</i>'s and its <i>t</i>'s
like <i>a</i>'s. England is still overrun by the Danes,
and does nothing before the very end of the century,
when King Alfred exerts himself to revive education,
and starts a vernacular literature.</p>

<p>An enormous proportion of the earliest copies
we have of classical Latin authors come from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><a href="images/37.png">[37]</a></span>
century, when old copies of them were actively
sought out and transcribed. Often great liberties
in the way of revision and even abridgment of the
text were taken by the scholars of the time, and,
once transcribed, the old archetypes were neglected
or even destroyed.</p>

<p>Books of very great beauty&mdash;Bibles, Gospels,
Psalters&mdash;were produced for the Emperors and the
great nobles and prelates. In these there is a
marked effort to imitate and continue the traditions
of classical art.</p>

<p><i>Tenth Century.</i>&mdash;The tradition of study and
scholarship lives on, but the impulse from Britain
and Ireland has worked itself out, and few geniuses
are born on the Continent. There is a period of
splendour and vigour in England under the Kings
Athelstan and Edgar and the Archbishops Odo
and Dunstan. The calligraphic school of Winchester
achieves magnificent results. At the end
of the century the great teacher and scholar
Gerbert (Pope Sylvester II.) is a prominent figure
at the Imperial Court. The Ottos emulate Charlemagne
in their zeal for literature and for fine works
of art, but their attainment is slighter.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh Century.</i>&mdash;Men still live on the traditions
of the Carolingian Revival in the early part: there
is later an awakening, principally, perhaps, in France
and Italy. Great names like those of Anselm,
Abelard, Bernard, come forward. Monastic reform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><a href="images/38.png">[38]</a></span>
is active; great schools, as at Chartres, take
their rise; there is a preparation for the wonderful
vigour of the next century. The First Crusade
brings East and West together in a new fashion.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Century.</i>&mdash;The strength and energy of
Europe is now tremendous in every department,
and not least in that with which we are concerned.
Our libraries are crammed to-day with twelfth-century
MSS. The Gregories, Augustines, Jeromes,
Anselms, are numbered by the hundred. It is the
age of great Bibles and of "glosses"&mdash;single books
or groups of books of the Bible equipped with a
marginal and interlinear comment (very many of
which, by the way, seem to have been produced in
North Italy). Immense, too, is the output of the
writers of the time; Bernard, Hugh and Richard
of St. Victor, Peter Comestor, Peter Lombard.
The two last are the authors of two of the most
popular of medieval textbooks&mdash;Peter Lombard
of the <i>Sentences</i> (a body of doctrine), Peter Comestor
of the <i>Historia Scholastica</i> (a manual of Scripture
history). The Cistercian Order, now founding
houses everywhere, is, I think, specially active
in filling its libraries with fine but austerely plain
copies of standard works, eschewing figured decoration
in its books, as in its buildings, and caring
little for secular learning. The University of
Paris is the centre of intellectual vigour.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth Century.</i>&mdash;This is commonly regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><a href="images/39.png">[39]</a></span>
as the greatest of all in medieval history; and truly,
when we think of achievements such as Westminster,
Amiens, and Chartres, and of men such as St.
Louis, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Francis, Dante,
Edward I., Roger Bacon, we must agree that the
popular estimate is sound. Certainly we see in
France and in England the fine flower of art in
buildings and in books.</p>

<p>Paris is still the centre. The "Gothic" spirit
is concentrated there. The book trade is enormous.
It is passing&mdash;under the influence of the University,
most likely&mdash;out of the hands of the monastic
scribes into those of the professional "stationers";
while great individual artists, such as Honor&eacute;,
arise to provide for Royal and noble persons examples
of art which stand as high to-day as when they
were first produced.</p>

<p>It is now that we find a large multiplication of
textbooks. If the twelfth century was the age
of great Bibles, the thirteenth is the age of small
ones. Thousands of these exist, written with
amazing minuteness and uniformity. Only less
common are the Aristotles, the <i>Sentences</i>, the
<i>Summ&aelig;</i>, and the other works of the golden age
of scholasticism. The Orders of Friars, Franciscan
and Dominican, form libraries&mdash;partly of duplicates
procured from older foundations, partly of new
copies to which they were helped by charitable
friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><a href="images/40.png">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the century Italy comes forward
as the great purveyor of books of a special
sort. The University of Bologna becomes the great
law school of Europe, and exports in numbers
copies of the immense texts and commentaries of
and upon the Church (Canon) and Roman (Civil)
law which were indispensable to the unfortunate
student. These books become common at the
end of the thirteenth century, and run over well
into the fourteenth. They are prettily (but often
very carelessly) written in a round Gothic hand,
sometimes christened "Bolognese." Some were
not only written but decorated (with poorish
ornament) on the spot, but very many were exported
in sheets and provided, in France or England, with
such decoration as the purchaser could afford.
A leading example is a copy of the Decretals in
the British Museum (Royal 10, E. iv.) which
belonged to St. Bartholomew's, Smithfield. It
is in Italian script, but on each of the spacious
lower margins of its many pages is a picture by an
English artist; these pictures run in sets, illustrating
Bible stories, legends, and romances.</p>

<p>As the centuries go on, the material they have
left increases in bulk, and the complication of the
threads is proportionately greater. I cannot hope
in a survey like this to give prominence to every
factor; but we shall not be wrong in fixing upon
Northern France and England as the areas of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><a href="images/41.png">[41]</a></span>
greatest productiveness and the sources of the best
art in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Before we pass to the next century a word must
be devoted to a not unimportant class of books
which seem to have been manufactured chiefly
in Picardy and Artois, the illustrated Romances&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
the Grail and Lancelot&mdash;of great bulk, usually
in prose, which served to pass the winter evenings
of persons of quality. A few of these, and a book
of devotions to take to church (oftenest a Psalter
at this time; later on a book of Hours), were the
staple books owned by the upper classes.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth Century.</i>&mdash;If the thirteenth century
gives us on the whole the noblest books, the early
part of the fourteenth affords the loveliest. They
come from England, France, and the Netherlands.
A noticeable element in their art is that of the
grotesque and burlesque, never, of course, quite
absent even from early books, but now most prominent
and most delightful. The defect of the art
of this time is lack of strength and austerity; its
delicacy is above praise.</p>

<p>The middle of the century sees Petrarch, and with
him the Renaissance begins. Italy has been producing
great men in every field, but the work of
Petrarch reached farther and was more enduring
than that of any other.</p>

<p>France, tortured by wars, put forth little in the
middle years, but then came Charles V., a King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><a href="images/42.png">[42]</a></span>
who was really interested in books, and the library
he formed at the Louvre gave a stimulus to book-production
which spread wide and lasted long.
Under Richard II. and through his Queen, Anne of
Bohemia, a foreign influence makes itself felt in
England, and some lovely results are achieved;
but on the whole English art is waning.</p>

<p>The Universities, and to some extent the monasteries,
were throughout this century great customers
for the bulky books of scholastic divinity (Duns
Scotus, Albertus, and the like) and the later generation
of commentators on the Bible, such as Nicolas
de Lyra and Hugo de S. Caro. Many shelves are
filled with these.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenth Century.</i>&mdash;The fifteenth century is our
last; it ends the MS. period. Under the influence
of the Renaissance, now enormously potent, every
Italian noble forms a library. The scholars are
seeking out the ninth-century copies of the classics,
and they discard the Gothic (black-letter) hands
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in favour
of the Carolingian minuscule (or, some say that of
the twelfth century). As early as 1426 we find
books written in a script adapted and refined from
this; we call it a Roman hand, though the great
centre of its propagation seems to have been
Florence. In all essentials it is the parent of the
type in which this page will be printed.</p>

<p>Italy, then, is the hub of the universe for books;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><a href="images/43.png">[43]</a></span>
and in Italy, Florence, Naples, and Rome are the
most active <i>nuclei</i>. We have a record written by
a Florentine bookseller, Vespasiano Bisticci, in
the form of short biographies of great persons,
many of whom had dealt with him. For some he
provided whole libraries, as for Frederick, Duke of
Urbino, whose books are now mostly in the Vatican.
Such a man as this would not look at a printed
book&mdash;which in Vespasiano's mind is, of course,
very greatly to his credit; for the press was bound
to put an end to his particular industry. We
still find, by the way, this prejudice against print
in the very last years of the century. Some rich
persons had MS. copies actually made from printed
editions and elaborately illustrated. Such a one
was Raphael de Marcatellis, natural son of Philip
the Good of Burgundy and titular Bishop of
Rhossus, near Antioch.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Part of his library may
be found at Ghent, part at Holkham, and stray
volumes at Cambridge (Peterhouse) and in the
Arundel collection at the British Museum. They
are very handsome books, and many have full-page
paintings by capable artists, but the resulting
impression is on the whole that of decadence.</p>

<p>Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary (d. 1490),
is a name famous among old bibliophiles. He
got together a library of fine books, mostly recent
copies made for him, and it was dispersed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><a href="images/44.png">[44]</a></span>
sacked by the Turks in 1526. It is spoken of with
bated breath by the old writers, as if it had contained
priceless treasures. I am sceptical.</p>

<p>Ferdinand of Aragon and Calabria was a collector
of the same kind, whose beautiful books, adorned
with his arms in the lower margin of the first page,
are many of them at Valencia, having passed to
the University there by way of the Abbey of St.
Miguel de Los Reyes. These are of Italian and not
of Spanish manufacture, and very fine they are.</p>

<p>These last-mentioned libraries have been scattered,
but there are still some of the Renaissance
period which survive in their original homes. The
Laurentian at Florence and the Vatican at Rome
stand at the head of all. With regard to the latter
it may be said that though earlier Popes, of course,
had libraries (that of Avignon was quite considerable),
yet Nicholas V. (d. 1455) must be regarded
as the founder of the Vatican library in its present
state. So, too, the Marciana at Venice and the
Malatestiana at Cesena must rank as genuine
Renaissance collections.</p>

<p>It was not only the great men who loved to have
books. The tribe of scholars, foreign as well as
native, who coveted them was numerous. Every
library now has its quota of humbler copies of the
classics, often on paper, in the Roman or the more
cursive Italic hand, not written by a professional
scribe. Often these are of infinitesimal value,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><a href="images/45.png">[45]</a></span>
transcripts of extant copies of no greater age;
but there is always the possibility that they may
be a competent scholar's own careful apograph
of some ancient MS. which a Poggio had unearthed
at St. Gall, and which has since vanished. A glance
at the <i>apparatus criticus</i> of a few editions of classics
will show that often a fifteenth-century MS. ranks
high among the authorities for the text. Pedigree
is what matters, not beauty of hand, nor, necessarily,
date.</p>

<p>It has been the fate of these scholars' books,
as it is the fate of all MSS., to be absorbed into great
libraries, and many of them lurk there still unexamined
and their origin undetermined. Discoveries,
no doubt, yet remain to be made among
them.</p>

<p>Whether or not a breath of influence from Italy
was the cause, it is plain that library-making was
popular in countries and circles which were not
obviously affected by the Renaissance. The monasteries
of England were certainly not so affected,
yet we find many of them setting their books in
order and building special rooms to contain them.
Christchurch at Canterbury and Bury St. Edmunds
are leading instances. Now, too, Universities and
colleges made fresh catalogues, and received large
accessions of books.</p>

<p>If the Renaissance did not touch the English
public as a whole in this century, it made some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><a href="images/46.png">[46]</a></span>
proselytes. Among Englishmen who dealt with
our Florentine Vespasiano were John Tiptoft,
Earl of Worcester, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
William Gray, Bishop of Ely, Andrew Holes, of
Wells. Others who resorted to Italy were John Free,
Thomas Linacre, John Gunthorpe, Dean of Wells,
William Flemming, Dean of Lincoln, William
Tilley of Sellinge, Prior of Christchurch, Canterbury.
We shall see later on what traces some of these
have left on our libraries.</p>

<p>In places to which the Italian influence did not
penetrate the humdrum trade of copying went on.
Anselm, Bernard, and Augustine; sermon-books
by the score; Burley on Aristotle, etc. Then,
in another class, the production of books for use in
church was very large. There were few Bibles,
but Missals, Breviaries, large choir-books to be laid
on the lectern, Graduals and Processionals, are
legion. Then, again, every well-to-do person must
have his or her Book of Hours, illuminated if
possible. Such things were common wedding-presents,
it seems. Upon the best of them really
great artists were employed, like Foucquet of Tours
and Gerard David; we even find Perugino painting
a page in one, but the average are shop work made
for the Italian market at Naples or Florence, for
the French at Paris, Tours, or Rouen, for the English
very often at Bruges, where also many sumptuous
chronicle books and French versions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><a href="images/47.png">[47]</a></span>
secular history and romances were turned out.
Edward IV. had a considerable number of such
in his library.</p>

<p>These private Prayer Books are, of course, incomparably
the commonest of all illuminated manuscripts.
They vary from loveliness to contemptibility.
Perversely, they figure in catalogues, and
are lettered on their backs, as Missals; our ancestors
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries forgot
that a Missal must contain the service of the Mass,
and that none of these books do.</p>

<p>There, then, is a second survey of our ground,
somewhat more detailed than the first, but woefully
sketchy. Everyone who has studied MSS. of any
class or period would detect omissions in it which
for him would vitiate the whole story. The best
I can hope is that the assertions in it are not incorrect,
and that it gives a true notion of the general
course of book-production in medieval times.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Wanderings of Latin MSS.: the Continent</span></h3>

<p>We are now to concern ourselves with the later
destinies of the books which we have seen in the
making. Here generalities will be less in place;
nevertheless, I must begin with some.</p>

<p>There are two main classes of persons interested
in MSS.: those who care for their literary contents,
and those who prize them for their artistic beauty.
Roughly speaking&mdash;very roughly&mdash;the precious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><a href="images/48.png">[48]</a></span>
literary things of ancient times were preserved in
monastic and cathedral libraries, and the beautiful
things in palaces and castles and church treasuries.
I do not forget that poetry and romance in
the vernacular were chiefly in the hands of
the laity, nor do I depreciate their value as
literature.</p>

<p>The ancient books, pagan and Christian, are
perhaps to be regarded as the backbone of the
subject, and therefore the first part of my enquiry
shall be devoted to the ecclesiastical libraries, and
considerations of space shall rule me on the other
head.</p>

<p>The monastic and cathedral libraries can be best
treated by countries. France, Germany, and
England will serve as specimens. Of Italy perhaps
enough has been said incidentally to attract attention
to the most important centres, such as Bobbio,
Monte Cassino, and Verona, and upon the whole
I do not think that in Italy this class of library
played so great a part in the later Middle Ages as
it did in the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>France is full of Latin MSS. Every considerable
town, besides many that are inconsiderable, has
its public library, into which at the Revolution were
collected the remains of the libraries of the religious
houses of the district. France's Dissolution came
at a time when many eyes were open to the possible
value of ancient books, and strings could be pulled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><a href="images/49.png">[49]</a></span>
and influence exercised to stem the unreasoning
fury that said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
We'll pull all arts and learning down,<br />
And hey, then, up go we!<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>It is easier, also, to rescue books than buildings.
The Revolutionists tore down a cathedral, and it
is gone; but books are portable and, moreover,
do not burn or tear or drown easily, especially
vellum MSS.; and when the first hurricane of idiocy
had blown over they were very likely found, rather
dustier than before, still on their shelves.</div>

<p>Nowadays our methods are more effective, of
course; but I have said as much about that as I
can bear.</p>

<p>If, then, one took a map of France and marked
down the principal abbeys, one would have a fair
<i>prima-facie</i> indication where to look for their MSS.
From Corbie, you would say, they went to Amiens,
from C&icirc;teaux to Dijon, from Bec and Mont St.
Michel to Avranches, and so on. This would be
right, but there are exceptions. Corbie, a specially
important library, is one.</p>

<p>When in 1636 the French under Louis XIII.
regained that territory from the Spaniards, the
precarious situation of its treasures was recognized,
and 400 select MSS. were taken to Paris. The
Reformed Benedictines of the Congregation of St.
Maur had done much at Corbie for the preservation
of the books, and they now petitioned that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><a href="images/50.png">[50]</a></span>
Corbie MSS. might not be alienated from the Order,
"n' ayant personne qui soit si jaloux de conserver
l'h&eacute;ritage de leurs p&egrave;res que les propres enfants."
The petition was successful, and the MSS. were
placed in the Abbey of St. Germain des Pr&egrave;s at
Paris. This was in 1638. In 1791, during the Revolutionary
troubles, there was a fire at the abbey,
and in the confusion a batch of early books was
stolen. These came into the hands of a Russian
envoy, Dubrowsky, and most of them, if not all,
are (or were until a more recent Revolution) in
the Imperial Library at Petrograd. The rest,
still a great collection, were drafted out of St.
Germain into the National Library in 1795-96.
Meanwhile a large number (including some very
important books) had remained at Corbie, and
these did go to Amiens in or about 1791.</p>

<p>But before 1636 Corbie MSS. had begun to stray
from home. One fairly clear case seems to be that
of the Harley MS. 3,063, which was once in the
library founded late in the fifteenth century at
Cues, on the Moselle, by Cardinal Nicholas of
Cues (<i>Cusanus</i>). It is one of two copies of the
Latin version of Theodore of Mopsuestia's Commentary
on the Pauline Epistles. The other is
a Corbie book at Amiens. Both show the same
gaps and blanks in the text, but the one is not
believed to be a direct copy of the other. Both
go back to a common original.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><a href="images/51.png">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Other Corbie books are at Montpellier. They
had a long roundabout journey to get there. Part
of a magnificent collection formed by successive
Bouhiers (seven of whom were Presidents of the
Parlement de Bourgogne, and lived at Dijon),
they were bought in 1781 from the heir of the last
Bouhier by the last Abbot but one of Clairvaux.
Then, when Clairvaux was suppressed at the Revolution,
its library went to Troyes. Government
commissioners were sent round to look through
the departmental libraries and note the most
valuable MSS. and printed books. One of those
who visited Troyes was a Montpellier professor,
Dr. Prunelle. The 300 and odd MSS. which he
put aside would, if precedent had been followed,
have gone to Paris, but they did in fact go to the
famous old school of medicine at Montpellier, and
there they are at this day.</p>

<p>One at least of the remarkable collection given
by Archbishop Parker to Corpus Christi College at
Cambridge (193), is a Corbie book&mdash;a product
evidently of the Corbie <i>scriptorium</i>, though it
bears on its first leaf the traces of an inscription
of ownership which, illegible as it is, does seem to be
that of another monastery. Parker's is, on the
whole, so English a collection that the presence
of this early French book arrests attention. It
does not, however, stand quite alone; there is a
rather similar one (334) which Professor Lindsay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><a href="images/52.png">[52]</a></span>
tells me is a Laon book of about the same (eighth-century)
date.</p>

<p>Corbie has occupied a considerable space, but it
is entitled to do so on several accounts. The
number of early MSS. traceable to it is very large,
their intrinsic interest is high, and for a third
reason I may again quote Professor Lindsay as
having decided, from a minute study of the abbreviations
used by Corbie scribes, that Anglo-Saxon
influences were at work in the formation of its
peculiar hand.</p>

<p>Corbie was, as I have hinted before, but one of
many venerable centres of learning in the northern
half of France. I shall not attempt a list of them,
but go on to note one salient fact, that the southern
half of the country is noticeably the poorer in MSS.</p>

<p>At Autun and Lyons, both of them magnificent
cities in Roman times, some very ancient books
did linger, and here is room for a digression. Lyons
had a Pentateuch in Latin which was a great rarity,
for not only was it in uncials of the fifth century,
but it was of the Old Latin version, that made from
the Greek before St. Jerome made his version
from the Hebrew, which we call the Vulgate.</p>

<p>Rather before the middle of the nineteenth century
an Italian adventurer of some learning and
little virtue, the Chevalier Guglielmo (etc.) Libri,
obtained employment under the French Government
in the Department of Public Instruction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><a href="images/53.png">[53]</a></span>
and was sent on a tour of inspection among provincial
libraries. He made this the occasion for
increasing a collection of MSS. which he had already
begun for his private uses. Where he found that
the town librarian was a good easy man, he removed
(silently) from his keeping a selection of the most
precious volumes, or, if it seemed unsafe to take
the whole of a MS., he detached some few quires.
Now and then he left a less valuable book in the
place of the other. His best hunting-grounds were
Tours, Orl&eacute;ans, and Lyons. At Lyons he conveyed
away the Book of Leviticus and part of
Numbers out of the Pentateuch. He had skilled
workmen in his pay at Paris, who wrote names of
other (generally Italian) monasteries and former
owners on the first page of the stolen books, and
otherwise disguised them; when he had made up
a selection of a suitable bulk and attractiveness,
he looked about for a wealthy purchaser, and
found one in the Earl of Ashburnham, who bought
<i>en bloc</i>, and whose manuscripts were not readily
made accessible to the public. So the Lyons
Leviticus and an illustrated sixth-century Pentateuch
from Tours and many other precious things
from Fleury (near Orl&eacute;ans) and elsewhere reposed in
England until the early eighties, when M. Leopold
Delisle made public the result of a most patient and
most subtle investigation of the whole fraud, and
a selection of the best of the plunder was got back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><a href="images/54.png">[54]</a></span>
for France. Sad to say, the municipalities which
had been most negligent in keeping their MSS.
refused to contribute to the recovery of them.
They are still at Paris, to the advantage of students,
but to the discredit of the provinces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Libri's reputation had been thoroughly
blown upon, and he retired from France, and was
dead in Italy or elsewhere before his crimes had been
atoned for. A great mass of his accumulations was
bought from the Ashburnhams by the Italians
and is now at Florence. Madame Libri survived,
like Madame Fosco, to defend his memory.</p>

<p>To return. In spite of the long history and
great wealth of Bordeaux, Marseilles, Arles, Narbonne,
Toulouse, you will not trace many famous
books to those places. The city which, on the whole,
has preserved its early manuscripts best is Albi,
but it was never a great centre of learning, and its
library, though extremely interesting, is not large.</p>

<p>However, we need not be surprised at the poverty
of a region which has had to undergo Albigensian
crusades, English occupation, wars of religion,
and a revolution.</p>

<p>Some of the great early libraries of Germany were
mentioned in our historical survey. Fulda and
Lorsch were as remarkable as any. At the present
day Fulda retains only the few Bonifacian MSS.
which rank as relics of the saint&mdash;the blood-stained
volume of Ambrose which was on Boniface when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><a href="images/55.png">[55]</a></span>
pagans killed him, his pocket copy of the Gospels,
the MS. written for Victor of Capua. The bulk of
its abbey library, which remained together until
the close of the sixteenth century, is dispersed and
gone, no one knows where. Some books are at
Cassel in the ducal library. Lorsch has nothing
<i>in situ</i>, but a good deal in the Vatican. Both houses
were instrumental in preserving the classics; we
owe to them Suetonius, Tacitus, Ammianus Marcellinus,
and part of Livy.</p>

<p>The Thirty Years' War was responsible for a
good deal of dispersion. Cargoes of books made
their way to England, and Archbishop Laud
bought and gave to the Bodleian many from
W&uuml;rzburg and Erf&uuml;rt; in the Arundel collection
at the British Museum the German contingent is
large. Sweden also profited at this time, and got
its lovely <i>Codex Aureus</i> (once at Canterbury), its
<i>Codex Argenteus</i> (the Gothic Gospels at Upsala), and
its <i>Gigas</i>, or Devil's Bible, which came from Prague.</p>

<p>In the Revolutionary period there was extensive
secularization of abbeys, and whole libraries passed
into central depots, as at Munich, which has the
MSS. of St. Emmeram of Ratisbon and of Tegernsee,
Benedictbeuern, Sch&auml;ftlarn, and many other
houses. Those of the old and rich foundation of
Reichenau passed to Carlsruhe. Precious books,
like the gold-covered Gospels of Lindau, were exported.
This particular gem was bought by Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><a href="images/56.png">[56]</a></span>
Ashburnham, and in recent years has gone to
America. Fine Gospels and other service-books
from Weingarten are at Holkham; they appeal to
the Englishman, for they contain pictures of our
sainted King Oswald, of whom Weingarten owned
a relic.</p>

<p>North Germany's contribution is far inferior
to that of Bavaria and the Rhine provinces. The
inhabitants of large regions were pagans till a late
date (some might say they were so still), and have
never, we conceive, been really civilized. Few
books were made there before the fourteenth
century, and I know of no good libraries that existed
there in the medieval period. A good part of
the contents of one at Elbing, near Dantzic, came
somehow to Cambridge (Corpus Christi) in the
seventeenth century; it is a dreary collection,
mostly on paper, of scholastic theology, sermons,
meditations, and a little medicine.</p>

<p>In Austria the abbeys were let alone till 1918.
Such houses as Melk on the Danube, St. Florian,
St. Paul in Carinthia, Admont in Styria, still owned
their estates, their revenues, and their libraries.
That of Melk is noticeable, and at St. Paul is, oddly
enough, one of the very earliest Irish vernacular
MSS. I believe it came thither in fairly recent
times from St. Blasien in the Black Forest. But,
on the whole, these places were too remote from
the main stream to accumulate many treasures of
the very first quality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><a href="images/57.png">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Latin MSS. in England</span></h3>

<p>Let me now turn to England, and treat in greater
detail of the monastic and cathedral libraries
there, and what happened to them. The Dissolution,
as we know, occurred here near on 400
years ago, which makes the task of tracing the
books at once harder and more fascinating than
in the case of France or Germany, where a whole
library may be found practically intact in a town
near its old home. Of course, what was done
there ought to have been done here. Leland,
the King's antiquary, the abusive Protestant,
John Bale, and the foolish but learned Dr. John
Dee, begged that it might be done. Yet, whatever
Henry VIII's or Mary's or Elizabeth's intentions
may have been at times as to the foundation of a
"solempne library" where the ancient books of
the realm might be stored, they got but a very
little way. Leland did secure some MSS. for the
Royal Library, perhaps most from Rochester, but
upon the whole the work was left in Elizabeth's
days to individual enthusiasts&mdash;Sir Robert Cotton,
Archbishop Parker, and Dee and Bale themselves.
Others who did good work were Henry Fitzalan,
Earl of Arundel; Lord William Howard; Long
Harry Savile of Bank; Laurence Nowell, who
rescued Anglo-Saxon books; Nicholas Brigam,
who was interested in English literature and built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><a href="images/58.png">[58]</a></span>
Chaucer's tomb in the Abbey; the Theyers of Brockworth,
near Gloucester. These are names to some
of which we shall return; it would be well at this
moment to take a few libraries one by one and see
what can be said of them.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Catalogues of MSS.</span></h3>

<p>But, first, what are our means for pursuing such
an investigation? We are best off if we have a
catalogue of our abbey library, and preferably a
late one; for in that case not only will the library
be at its fullest, but probably the cataloguer will
have set down, after the title of each book, the
first words of its second leaf. Does this need explanation?
Perhaps. In MSS., unlike printed
books, the first words of the second leaf will be
different in any two copies, say, of the Bible; the
scribes did not make a page for page or line for line
copy of their archetype&mdash;in fact, they may probably
have avoided doing so purposely. By the
help of such a catalogue we can search through
collections of MSS., noting the second leaves in
each case, and, it may be, identifying a considerable
number of books. It is a laborious but an interesting
process.</p>

<p>But, alas! such catalogues are very few; we have
them for Durham, St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury
(and partly also for Christchurch), St. Paul's
Cathedral, Exeter Cathedral, Dover Priory, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><a href="images/59.png">[59]</a></span>
Austin Friars of York (all now in print), and for
not many more.</p>

<p>Next best it is to have a catalogue enumerating
the contents of each volume; and next, and commonest,
one which gives usually but a single title
to each. Among the most useful I reckon those
of Christchurch, Canterbury, Peterborough (an
anomalous one), Glastonbury, Bury St. Edmunds,
Rochester, Dover, Lincoln, Leicester Abbey (not yet
printed in full), Ramsey, Rievaulx, Lanthony-by-Gloucester,
Titchfield. There are a good many
short catalogues for smaller houses, written on the
fly-leaves of books, which do not, as a rule, help
us much. The list of monastic catalogues, however,
is dreadfully defective. We have none for St.
Albans or Norwich or Crowland or Westminster,
for Gloucester or Worcester, St. Mary's, York, or
Fountains. What do we do in such cases?</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>The Evidence of MSS. Themselves</span></h3>

<p>We have to depend, of course, on the evidence
of the MSS. themselves. It was happily a common
practice to write on the fly-leaf or first leaf <i>Liber
(Sancte Marie) de (tali loco)</i>. This is decisive. Then,
again, some libraries devised a system of press-marks,
such as "N. lxviii.," let us say. You find
this in conjunction with the inscription of ownership;
it is a Norwich book, you discover, that you
have in hand, and all books showing press-marks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><a href="images/60.png">[60]</a></span>
of that form are consequently Norwich books too.
Or you will find the name of a donor. "This
book was the gift of John Danyell, Prior." Search
in Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i> will reveal, perhaps,
that John Danyell was Prior of St. Augustine's,
Bristol, in 1459. A clue to locality will often be
given in such a case by the monk's surname, for
it was their custom to call themselves by the name
of their native village. Thus, a monk named
John Melford or William Livermere will be a Suffolk
man, and the abbey in which he was professed is
likely to be Bury. Coming to later times, it is
apparent that at the Dissolution groups of books
from a single abbey came into the hands of a single
man. If I find Dakcombe on the fly-leaf of a MS.,
I am almost entitled to assume that it is a Winchester
book: John Stonor got his books from Reading
Abbey, John Young drew from Fountains,
and so forth. Lastly, and most rarely, you are
justified in saying that the handwriting and decoration
of this or that book shows it to have been
written at St. Albans or at Canterbury. Hitherto
the instances where this is possible are few, but I
do not doubt that multiplication of observations
will add to their number.</p>

<p>In questioning a MS. for any of these indications
(except the last) you must be on the look-out for
signs of erasures, especially on the margins of the
first leaf and on the fly-leaves at either end. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><a href="images/61.png">[61]</a></span>
the owner's name was usually written. Often it
was accompanied by a curse on the wrongful possessor,
and at the Dissolution there were many wrongful
possessors, who, whether disliking the curse
or anticipating trouble from possible buyers,
thought it well to erase name, and curse, and all.
They seldom did it so thoroughly that the surface
of the vellum does not betray where it was, and it
can be revived by the dabbing (<i>not</i> painting) upon
it of ammonium bisulphide, which, unlike the old-fashioned
galls, does not stain the page. Dabbed
on the surface with a soft paint-brush, and dried
off at once with clean blotting paper, it makes the
old record leap to light, sometimes with astonishing
clearness, sometimes slowly, so that the letters
cannot be read till next day. It is not always
successful; it is of no use to apply it to writing in
red, and its smell is overpowering, but it is the
elixir of pal&aelig;ographers.</p>

<p>Yet, when all has been done, there is a sadly
large percentage of MSS. which preserve an obstinate
silence. They have been rebound (that is
common), and have lost their fly-leaves in the
process, or, worse than that, they have lain tossing
about without a binding and their first and last
quires have dropped away. In such cases we can
only tell, from our previous experience in ancient
handwritings, the date and country of their
origin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><a href="images/62.png">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>English Libraries</span></h3>

<p>And now to turn to some individual libraries.
Some of the most venerable have practically disappeared&mdash;that
of Glastonbury, for instance, the
premier abbey of England, the only one which lived
through from British to Saxon times.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> To it we
might reasonably look to trace many an ancient
book belonging to the days of the old British
Church. Leland, who visited the library not
long before the Dissolution, represents himself
as overawed by its antiquity. But almost the only
record he quotes is one by "Melkinus," which most
modern writers think was a late forgery. However,
there is in the Bodleian one British book from
Glastonbury, written, at least in part, in Cornwall,
and preserving remnants of the learning of the
British clergy. It has portions of Ovid and of Latin
grammar, and passages of the Bible in Greek and
Latin. The catalogue, too, shows that there were
in fact a good number of old MSS., and also that
the monks of the fourteenth century did not care
much about them, for they are marked as "Old and
useless," "Old and in bad condition" (<i>debilis</i>), and
so on. The actual extant books which we can trace
to this foundation are few and for the most part late.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><a href="images/63.png">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>St. Albans, founded by King Offa in the eighth
century, has left us, as I said, no catalogue, but
there are many of its books in our libraries. Two
groups of them stand out. First are those procured
by Abbot Simon (1166-1188) and Prior Mathias.
These are very finely written. A typical and very
interesting specimen is a Bible at Eton (26) which
has three columns to a page&mdash;a rare distinction in
the twelfth century, pointing, perhaps, to its having
been copied from a very early and venerable model.
It has a sister book at Corpus Christi, Cambridge,
and another&mdash;a New Testament&mdash;at Trinity College,
Dublin. Then we have a large and important
group of histories. The historiographers of St.
Albans form a series reaching from Roger of
Wendover (d. 1236) to Thomas Walsingham
(d. 1422). The greatest of them was Matthew
Paris (d. 1259). We have authentic and even
autograph copies of many of these works, and
especially of Paris's (at Corpus Christi, Cambridge
(26 and 16), and in the British Museum, Royal 14,
C. vii., Cotton Nero D. 1, etc.). And we have not
only Paris's writing, but many of his drawings,
for he was an accomplished artist. All these books
furnish us with material for judging of the handwriting
used at St. Albans in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and we can speak with fair
confidence of St. Albans books of that period.</p>

<p>As in other cases, I believe that many books were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><a href="images/64.png">[64]</a></span>
written there for other monasteries, either as gifts
or as a matter of business. Not every one of the
little priories scattered all over the country had its
own scriptorium; it was only natural that they
should apply to the big establishments when they
wanted a Bible or service-book or commentary
of really good quality. This practice explains
the fact that we quite often find books which we
could make oath are products of St. Albans or of
Canterbury, and which yet have inscriptions,
written when they were new books, showing that
they were owned by some small house. Let me
here note two other ways in which books wandered
from the great abbeys. <i>One</i>: all the abbey libraries
were full of duplicates; read any catalogue, and you
will realize that. When the Orders of Friars were
collecting libraries of their own, and when the
colleges in the two Universities were doing the same,
they found that the monks were often willing to
part with one of their eight or nine sets of Gregory's
<i>Moralia</i> or Augustine <i>On the Trinity</i> for a consideration.
<i>Two</i>: most of the large abbeys maintained
hostels at the Universities, singly or jointly,
in which some of their younger members studied
for degrees. These hostels were equipped with
libraries, and the libraries were furnished from
the shelves of the mother-houses. We have at
least two lists of books so used: one of those which
Durham sent to what is now Trinity College,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><a href="images/65.png">[65]</a></span>
Oxford; the other of those which Christchurch,
Canterbury, deported to Canterbury College, Oxford,
which stood on the site of Canterbury Quad,
in Christ Church.</p>

<p>There was some compensation, by the way:
the abbeys were not invariably the losers. A
group of books (at Lambeth) was procured to be
written by a Canon of Lanthony when he was
studying at Oxford (about 1415), and given to the
library of his priory.</p>

<p>We have digressed from the particular to the
general. Returning to individual libraries, let us
glance at the Norwich Cathedral Priory. Of this,
again, we have no catalogue; it is a case in which
press-marks and names of owners are our guides.
Norwich has a system of press-marks consisting
of a letter of the alphabet plus a Roman numeral:
"N. lxviii." The press-marks of several other
houses consist of just the same elements, but we
can pick out that of Norwich by its size (not large)
and its position (top of the first leaf of text); also
there is usually added to it the name of the monk
who procured it for the house, Henry de Lakenham
or W. Catton&mdash;someone whose surname is the
name of a Norfolk village. Over a hundred MSS.
from Norwich are known to me, but they are a
very small fraction of the library, as is shown by
the numerals attached to the several class letters.
Very few of them are as old as the twelfth century;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><a href="images/66.png">[66]</a></span>
late twelfth and particularly early fourteenth make
up the bulk. I attribute this to the great fire of
1286, and I take it that then the greater part of
the priory books were spoiled, and that energetic
steps to refill the library were taken in the years
that followed. There are more Norwich books
in the University Library at Cambridge than
anywhere else; it has not been proved, but I do not
much doubt, that most of them were given by the
chapter to Cambridge about 1574, at the suggestion
of Dr. Andrew Perne, Master of Peterhouse, who was
a member of the cathedral body and an enthusiast
for the University Library.</p>

<p>Not very dissimilar was the action of Exeter
Chapter, who in 1602 gave over eighty of their MSS.
to Sir Thomas Bodley's new library in Oxford,
Bodley's brother being then a Canon of Exeter;
and not long after the Canons of Worcester picked
out a score of their MSS., for Dean Williams's
new library at Westminster Abbey. These, however,
I believe were never actually sent off. It is
just as well, for the Westminster MSS. were burnt
in 1694. Of Bury St. Edmunds I have attempted
to write the history elsewhere, but it is not likely
that many readers of this book will be familiar with
my former publication. The only catalogue we
have for this abbey is an early one (eleventh to
twelfth century) written on the fly-leaves of a copy
of Genesis (glossed) at Pembroke College, Cambridge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><a href="images/67.png">[67]</a></span>
Thus it contains no fourteenth or fifteenth
century books, nor, indeed, has it many entries of
extant books of earlier date which we are sure
belonged to Bury; but it is not to be despised,
though we depend more upon press-marks than upon
it for guidance. Bury press-marks were an introduction
of the late fourteenth or early fifteenth
century. Soon after 1400 Abbot Curteys built
a library, and it was under the care of the monk,
John Boston, who, I think, is responsible for the
press-marks, as he certainly is for the copious
bibliographical notices which occurred in some of
the books. The press-marks consist of a capital
letter and an <i>arabic</i> numeral (A. 130). Here,
again, one has to be familiar with the handwriting
of the marks and their position (top of first leaf
and fly-leaf) in order to distinguish them from those
of Exeter (often on last fly-leaf and large) or of the
Hereford Franciscans (large, on first fly-leaf).
However, in most cases they are backed up by the
older inscription <i>Liber S. &AElig;dmundi regis et martiris</i>.
Bury library has, on the whole, fared well; an
Alderman of Ipswich, William Smart, procured
over 100 of its MSS., which he gave to Pembroke
College, Cambridge, in 1599, and about 150 others
are scattered up and down the country. One
Bury book of extreme interest&mdash;not a library
book, but a register&mdash;was taken across the Channel
in the sixteenth century by a Bury monk to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><a href="images/68.png">[68]</a></span>
settlement of the Benedictine refugees at Douai.
Since the Revolution it has been (<i>perhaps</i> still is)
in the town library there. Its importance is that
it contains a list of the benefactors of the abbey,
and among other things records the burial-places
of the Abbots, including the famous Samson. In
recent years it has guided excavators to the discovery
of his bones. With it is a Psalter of extraordinary
beauty, one of a group of marvellous
books done in East Anglia&mdash;some say at Gorleston&mdash;soon
after 1300. I grieve to hear that it has been
severely damaged by damp. It has in it the name
of an Abbot, John, who, I wish to believe, was of
Bury, but doubt is thrown on this.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>English MSS. on the Continent</span></h3>

<p>A digression is allowable here as to English
books that have passed to the Continent. According
to Bale and Dee, there was a great expatriation
of them at the Dissolution. In Archbishop Parker's
correspondence there is talk of the negotiations
of a German scholar, Flacius Illyricus, who wanted
to buy Bale's MSS. after his death. At an earlier
time Poggio visited England in the hope of unearthing
classical authors, but writes as if he had been
unsuccessful. Then, again, Sigismund Gelenius
in 1550 edits at Basel treatises of Tertullian from
a MS. belonging to the Abbey of "Masbury"
(which I take to be Malmesbury), lent to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><a href="images/69.png">[69]</a></span>
by Leland. More instances could no doubt be
collected, but not, I think, very many more.
When we come to enquire what English books
are to be found now in Continental libraries,
the results are not very impressive. I exclude
the very early exportations, some of which
have been mentioned, and confine myself to the
books which were taken over at and after the
Dissolution. There is a Bury Psalter with drawings
at the Vatican, a St. Albans Psalter at Hildesheim,
a fine Book of Hours at Nuremberg, a Winchester
Pontifical at Rouen, a Sherborne Book at Paris,
a Ramsey Psalter at an Austrian abbey, another
English Psalter at the Escurial. The Canterbury
<i>Codex Aureus</i> is at Stockholm. The famous
Utrecht Psalter, written, perhaps, in the Rheims
district, strayed from the Cotton collection to its
present home in Holland, we do not know how.
All these, and some other remarkable illuminated
books that could be named (I ought not to omit
a Peterborough Psalter at Brussels), are not library
books, but rather properties of great ecclesiastics
or nobles. The largest collections have never yet
been thoroughly searched. I myself have made
many enquiries and some examinations with small
result. One case there is, however, brought to
light by the late Rev. H. M. Bannister, which gives
hope of better things when a systematic search
is carried out. He found that in the Vatican<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><a href="images/70.png">[70]</a></span>
Library there are quite a large number of MSS.
from the libraries of the Friars at Cambridge.
They are late and not very important books, but
no matter for that: the point is that they are there.
Other instances known to me are&mdash;one at least
of Sir Kenelm Digby's MSS. and one of Lord Burleigh's
(a fourteenth-century volume of English
historians) at Paris; the Greek Demosthenes already
noticed at Leyden, and a MS. from Pembroke
College (Seneca), also there. The Vossian collection
at the same place has other books which I
suspect were once in England; most notable is its
Suidas, which is said by M. Bidez to be the parent
of the English copies I mentioned, and which I
think must be Grosseteste's own copy. This,
however, is a Greek MS. A volume containing
poems of Milo of St. Amand is most likely a Canterbury
book. But the early books in Irish script,
of which there are several, were probably written
on the Continent.</p>

<p>At Wolfenb&uuml;ttel is a "Wycliffe" Bible, large and
handsome, which belonged to Lord Lumley (d. 1609),
and also a copy of Gervase of Tilbury (that from
which the text was first printed by Leibnitz) from
the library of St. Augustine of Canterbury. There,
too, are many MSS. collected by Flacius Illyricus,
who made purchases in England. He printed
many of the rhyming Latin poems attributed to
Walter Map; for a good many his edition is the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><a href="images/71.png">[71]</a></span>
authority, his MSS. having disappeared. I had
hoped to find some of them at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, but
they do not seem to be there. What I did find
was a small group of MSS. from St. Andrews in
Scotland, containing rhyming poems set to music;
they are books of the thirteenth century, well
written and decorated. Scotch monastic MSS.
are of rare occurrence. There are few enough in
Scotland itself, not many in England, and, of course,
still fewer anywhere else. At Upsala is a book
written by Clement Maydestone of Sion for Wadstena,
the Swedish mother-house of the Brigittine
Order to which he belonged.</p>

<p>There were probably some English books at
Turin, which was a mixed collection, but the fire
of 1904 has made away with them. The old
catalogue by Pasini notices at least one service-book
with English saints. But it is time to bring this
excursus to an end. Let me only add that the most
famous English book on the Continent&mdash;the
Vercelli MS. of Anglo-Saxon poems and homilies&mdash;seems
to have been where it is now since the
thirteenth or fourteenth century.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Remains of Medieval Libraries</span></h3>

<p>Once again we return to these shores, and now
we will enquire what medieval libraries, besides
those we have glanced at, have left really considerable
remains. Some few have kept their books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><a href="images/72.png">[72]</a></span>
<i>in situ</i>&mdash;the monastic cathedrals of Durham and
Worcester best of all; each has some hundreds of
MSS. The secular cathedrals, Lincoln, Hereford,
Salisbury, come next. Rochester has nothing on
the spot, but a great many MSS. in the old Royal
Library in the British Museum. The two great
libraries of Canterbury (Christchurch and St.
Augustine's) are well represented, but their books
are much scattered. Winchester, York, Exeter,
have few but precious books.</p>

<p>There are important MSS. from Thorney at the
Advocates Library, Edinburgh; from St. Mary's
York, at Dublin; not a few from Cirencester at
Jesus College, Oxford, and at Hereford; St. John's,
Oxford, has many from Reading and from Southwick
(Hants). There must, I am sure, be many
Peterborough books to be found, but they are
rarely marked as such, and the character of the
catalogue makes identification very hard.</p>

<p>Of all minor libraries, that of Lanthony, near
Gloucester, has, I believe, been best preserved.
A great block of it was retained by the last Prior
of the house, John Hart, who retired to a country
house near by, and whose sister married a man of
good position, Theyer, in the neighbourhood. He
kept the books together, and had descendants who
valued them and added largely to their number.
At the end of the sixteenth century Archbishop
Bancroft conceived the idea of founding a library<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><a href="images/73.png">[73]</a></span>
at Lambeth for his successors, and he seems to
have bought about 150 Lanthony MSS. from
Theyer,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> which are now at Lambeth. Other
Lanthony books are at Trinity and Corpus Christi,
Oxford. A fourteenth-century catalogue of the
books among the Harley MSS. shows that we
possess at least a third of the whole collection.</p>

<p>Examples of the press-marks used by the various
houses have been collected by the New Pal&aelig;ographical
Society, and may be seen in their publications.
They are, of course, most useful in cases
where the inscription of ownership has not been
inserted or has disappeared. The second case may
be that of any book; the first is common to the
Canterbury libraries, to Dover, the London Dominicans,
St. Mary's York, Fountains, Titchfield, Ely.
To the press-marks figured by the Society more will
doubtless be added. I can instance one, that of the
Franciscans of Lincoln, which is of this form: <img src="images/symbol.png" width="19" height="20" alt="Symbol" title="" />.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Disappearance of Classical and other MSS.</span></h3>

<p>Passing over the painful subject of the wholesale
destruction of MSS. which must have followed the
Dissolution, I will give a few lines to an interesting
question little mooted as yet. Is there evidence
that England possessed many ancient writings
which have since disappeared, or which have
survived only in a few copies in other parts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><a href="images/74.png">[74]</a></span>
Europe? Take the classics first. Poggio, as I
have said, writes in a disappointed tone of his
researches here, but these were neither long nor
exhaustive. We have better testimony from
John of Salisbury, who in the twelfth century
quotes parts of the <i>Saturnalia</i> of Macrobius which
have dropped out of all the MSS. we now have.
He also read a tract attributed to Plutarch, called
the <i>Instruction of Trajan</i>; it was probably not by
Plutarch, but it was an ancient work, and is now
lost. Petronius Arbiter was known to him, even
that longest and most interesting piece of Petronius
called the <i>Supper of Trimalchio</i>, for which our only
authority is the late paper MS. at Paris that was
found in Dalmatia in the seventeenth century. But
no medieval English scholar can be shown to have
read Tacitus, or the lost parts of Livy, or Catullus,
Tibullus, Propertius, or others of the rarer Latin
authors. Next for Christian antiquity. The Vercelli
MS. gives a poetical version in Anglo-Saxon
of the Acts of St. Andrew in the land of the Anthropophagi
which have ceased to exist in Latin (so,
too, &AElig;lfric knew, and rejected, a poem on the
adventures of St. Thomas in India). In one of its
Homilies the same Vercelli MS. presents us with a
translation of the Apocalypse of St. Thomas, a
book of which until recently only the name was
known. Two early MSS. contain short quotations
in Latin from Cosmas Indicopleustes, a traveller
of Justinian's time whose work remains only in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><a href="images/75.png">[75]</a></span>
few copies, and is in Greek. Another has a
fragment of the lost <i>Book of Jannes and Jambres</i>;
another a chapter of the <i>Book of Enoch</i>, valuable
as one of our few indications that a Latin version
of it was current. John of Salisbury quotes a
story about St. Paul which seems to come from the
ancient apocryphal Acts of that Apostle. First
on the list (twelfth century) of the library of
Lincoln Minster (but lined through as if subsequently
lost) is a title <i>Proverbia Grecorum</i>. What
this book was is obscure; probably it was a translation
from Greek by an Irish scholar. It is quoted
extensively by Sedulius, the Irishman, and also
in a collection of treatises by an unknown York
writer (the Germans call him the <i>Yorker anonymus</i>)
of the eleventh to twelfth centuries. The work of
Iren&aelig;us <i>Against Heresies</i> (we only have it complete
in Latin) was always rare, but there were at least
two copies of it in England, one in the Carmelites'
Library at Oxford, the other given by Archbishop
Mepham to Christchurch, Canterbury. The latter,
I believe, we still have in the Arundel collection in
the British Museum. The MS. of Tertullian which
Gelenius got from England is gone, and our knowledge
of the treatise <i>On Baptism</i> which it contained
depends wholly on his printed text.</p>

<p>I cannot doubt that among the books imported
in the seventh century from Italy by Benedict
Biscop and Theodore and Hadrian, and in the
great library of York, which Alcuin panegyrizes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><a href="images/76.png">[76]</a></span>
in his poem on the saints of York, there were texts
now lost. But the Danes made a clean sweep of
all those treasures, as they did of the whole vernacular
literature of Northumbria, undoubtedly a
rich one. The scattered indications I have collected
in the preceding paragraphs point to the fact that
some strange and rare books did lurk here and
there in English libraries. It is almost a relief
that catalogues do not tell us of supremely desirable
things, such as Papias on the Oracles of the Lord,
or the complete Histories or Annals of Tacitus.</p>

<p>Another word on a topic akin to the last. I have
said more than once that the men of the later
Middle Ages did not value early books as such;
they were difficult to read, and often in bad
condition. At first they were apt to be made into
palimpsests; but when good new parchment became
abundant and comparatively cheap, this practice
was dropped. I conjecture that there is no
important palimpsest whose upper writing is later
than the eleventh century. The fate of the early
books is rather obscure to me, but I see that bits
of them were not uncommonly used for lining
covers and fly-leaves for MSS. of the thirteenth to
fifteenth centuries, and perhaps still oftener as
wrappers for documents. Binders of the sixteenth
century, and especially those who lived after the
Dissolution, used up service-books and scholastic
theology and Canon law to a vast extent, but early
books not so lavishly. There are cases in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><a href="images/77.png">[77]</a></span>
one is left doubtful as to whether the binder or his
employer did not insert the old leaves with the
definite wish to preserve them. I think of the
leaves of a Gospel book bound at the end of the
Utrecht Psalter, of a fragment of another fine
Gospels in an Arundel MS. at the College of Arms,
of some splendid Canons of the Gospels in the
Royal MS. 7. C. xii; but in the cases that follow I
think that accident and not design has been at work,
viz.: the fragments of several venerable volumes
at Worcester, admirably edited of late by Mr. C. H.
Turner; the leaves of a great sixth-century Bible
found by Mr. W. H. Stevenson wrapping up
Lord Middleton's documents at Wollaton; uncial
fragments of Eucherius in the Cambridge University
Library; other uncial leaves at Winchester
College; bits of &AElig;lfric's Grammar at All Souls';
of a Gallican Missal at Gonville and Caius; of an
early Orosius (from Stavelot) in the British Museum
and elsewhere; of an Orosius and Fortunatus at
Pembroke College, Cambridge; and so on. My
examples are set down almost at random.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Collectors of Books</span></h3>

<p>We pass now from the monastic circle to that of
the learned book collectors before and after the
Dissolution. Many of the best medieval book-buyers
were Abbots or Priors, and the history of
their collections is merged in that of their abbeys.
Leaving them aside, we find in fourteenth-century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><a href="images/78.png">[78]</a></span>
England one name which everyone has heard&mdash;that
of Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, and
author of the <i>Philobiblion</i>. I am inclined to think
that he was a humbug; his book is of the kind that
it is proper to translate, print on hand-made paper,
and bind in a vellum wrapper, but it tells us just
nothing of what books De Bury had or read, and I
could not point to a single work of any importance
which he was instrumental in bringing to light or
preserving. Persons who take pains to advertise
themselves as book-lovers or bibliomaniacs are
rarely those who render great services to literature.</p>

<p>Perhaps the libraries of the pre-Reformation
colleges of Oxford and Cambridge are the best
hunting-grounds for traces of the early collectors.
At Peterhouse, Cambridge is a large bequest from
John Warkworth, Master late in the fifteenth
century; another from J. Dyngley, Fellow, whose
books were written expressly for him; yet another
from H. Deynman, Master, who was interested in
medicine. Here, too, we come upon the tracks of
Roger Marchall, who must rank, on the whole, as
a student of natural science. Books with his name
and his carefully written tables of contents are at
Peterhouse, Gonville and Caius, Lambeth, the
British Museum, King's College; one at Magdalene
College (Pepys Library) came thither from Peterhouse
via Dr. John Dee. Walter Crome was
another fifteenth-century benefactor of the University
Library and of Gonville Hall, who, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><a href="images/79.png">[79]</a></span>
Dyngley, had books written to his order. These
are Cambridge <i>data</i>. Just such another list could
be made out for some Oxford colleges, particularly
Merton, Balliol, and New College. In this Bishops
William Rede of Chichester, and John Trillek of
Hereford, and William Gray of Ely, would figure
prominently. The mention of this last name will
serve as a pretext for introducing the Renaissance
scholars. Gray, we saw, was one of those who
dealt with Vespasiano Bisticci of Florence, though
not nearly all of the many MSS. of his giving which
are at Balliol are Italian-written; a good number
are by Flemish and German scribes. The other
men to whom I alluded in the same connection
were for the most part benefactors of Oxford.
John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, beheaded in 1470
for treason, promised a large gift of books to the
University, but they never reached it, nor do I
know a single MS. to-day that was Tiptoft's
property, though there can be no doubt that he
was a considerable book-buyer. Humphrey, Duke
of Gloucester (whom we are now forbidden to call
"the Good"), did give the University what was
then a large library; his name is inseparably associated
with the great room of the Bodleian, but
his books were swept away in Edward VI.'s days.
Some few have come back to their old home, and
others are in London and in Paris: twenty-nine is
said to be the total. He intended further gifts,
but he was cut off in 1444, and it is thought that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><a href="images/80.png">[80]</a></span>
one collection, perhaps his travelling library, was
diverted to King's College, Cambridge. It is
certain that soon after 1450 that college possessed
some 174 MSS., among which such titles as Plato's
<i>Republic</i> in Latin and a Greek-English dictionary
betray a humanistic influence which is not likely
to have been that of our founder, Henry VI.
Moreover, the only one of those MSS. that remains
is a Latin version of some orations of St. Athanasius,
made by a secretary of the Duke, and dedicated <i>to</i>
the Duke; and in the British Museum is another
volume of Athanasius translated by the same man,
which actually has Duke Humphrey's inscription
in it. This is respectable evidence in support of
the King's College story.</p>

<p>William Flemming, Dean of Lincoln, and founder
of Lincoln College, Oxford, gave a number of books
to that society which show him to have been
interested in the revival of learning; Greek MSS.
are among them.</p>

<p>John Gunthorpe, Dean of Wells (d. 1498), is said
by Leland to have bequeathed the large collection
he brought from Italy to Jesus College, Cambridge.
It is scattered and gone from there, but books of
Gunthorpe's survive in a good many libraries.
One deserves special mention&mdash;a Latin prose
version of the Odyssey, which he picked up (not
in Italy, though it is an Italian book, but at
Westminster) in 1475. Probably it was the first
copy of the Odyssey in any form that had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><a href="images/81.png">[81]</a></span>
to this country since Roman times, unless, indeed,
Archbishop Theodore brought one over in the
seventh century. Archbishop Parker thought that
he had, and the MS. which he fondly believed to
be Theodore's was in his view the pearl of the
collection he left to Corpus Christi. Certainly
it has the name <i>Theodorus</i> in it in letters of gold;
but, as certainly, it is a fifteenth-century book, and
the Theodore for whom it was written was I believe
Theodore Gaza, a humanist who lived in Italy.</p>

<p>An instance of a man interested in books and not
unaffected by the Renaissance, though not himself
a collector, may be introduced here. William
Wyrcestre (or Botoner, or Worcester) is the man,
and he deserves a special study. Some have
called him the father of English antiquaries, in
virtue of one of his notebooks which has been
preserved, and which contains jottings about his
travels in England; it is a sort of rude elementary
Leland's <i>Itinerary</i>. It is by no means the only
book of his compiling, nor the only one owned by
him that we have. There are historical and literary
collections of his, and not a few MSS. with his
name in them. He knew John Free, the translator
(reputed) of Diodorus Siculus, and he had read
Cristoforo Buondelmonte's book on the islands
of the Greek archipelago.</p>

<p>A long list of the Elizabethan book-collectors
could be made, but I shall not attempt one here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><a href="images/82.png">[82]</a></span>
Two libraries of the time, Sir Robert Cotton's and
Archbishop Parker's, stand out. The main object
of both men was to preserve English antiquities,
and it is no exaggeration to say that if these two
collections, which together number less than 1,500
volumes, had been wiped out, the best things in
our vernacular literature and the pick of our
chronicles would be unknown to us now. We
should have no <i>Beowulf</i> or <i>Judith</i>, only inferior
copies of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and of Matthew
Paris, no Layamon, no <i>Pearl</i>&mdash;not to speak of the
mass of invaluable State-papers gathered by
Cotton, and the Reformation documents and
letters stored up by Parker. One touch of blame
rests on Sir Robert Cotton. He had a vicious
habit of breaking up MSS. and binding together
sections from different volumes. This disguises
the provenance of the books, and by consequence
obscures the history of their contents.</p>

<p>Enough information about the Cotton and Parker
MSS. is easily accessible to absolve me from writing
much about them here. Less is generally known
of two dispersed collections, those of John Bale
and John Dee.</p>

<p>Bale must, I fear, have been an unamiable man&mdash;certainly
a very queer Christian. But his controversial
works, on which he doubtless prided himself
most, are dead and very rotten, while those devoted
to the more peaceful science of bibliography are
of abiding value. In his larger one, <i>Scriptorum</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><a href="images/83.png">[83]</a></span>
<i>Britannicorum Centuri&aelig;</i>, he inserts a list of the
MSS. he had once owned; they were no longer in
his hands, but, it is to be supposed, in Ireland, left
there when he fled from his bishopric of Ossory
on Mary's accession. It is not a very scientific
list, not one that gives the contents of each volume,
but merely names of treatises, groups of which
no doubt went to make up volumes, and this makes
it difficult to determine how much of his library
is in existence now. After his death it was in
England, and a syndicate of Germans, including,
as was said above, Flacius Illyricus, were negotiating
for the purchase of it. Archbishop Parker
also had an eye upon it; he had received books as
gifts or loans from Bale in former years. I have
not been able to make sure whether any of the books
did actually go to the Continent; I doubt it, in
fact. Many distinguished by Bale's curious small,
"flat" handwriting are traceable among Cotton's
and Parker's books, at Lambeth, at Cambridge,
and doubtless also at Oxford (where there is at
least the MS. of his <i>Index Scriptorum</i>, admirably
edited by Mr. R. L. Poole and Miss Bateson).
Bale was a Carmelite in his youth and interested
in the history of his Order, and there is an <i>a priori</i>
probability that any book dealing with Carmelite
affairs will contain marks of his ownership.</p>

<p>Dr. John Dee's history has often been written,
and the catalogue of the MSS. he owned has long
been in print in a Camden society volume (<i>Diary</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><a href="images/84.png">[84]</a></span>
<i>of Dr. John Dee</i>) edited by Halliwell. The main
facts of his life that concern us are that he lived at
Mortlake, and in 1584 went on a wild journey to
Poland. In his absence his house and collections
were plundered by a mob, who, not without excuse,
thought him a warlock. When he returned in
1589 he set himself to recover his scattered property,
and to a great extent succeeded. He moved from
Mortlake to Manchester, being made Warden of
the college there in 1595; later on he returned, and
died at Mortlake, much in debt, I think, in 1608.
I find from Archbishop Ussher's printed correspondence
that his books were still unsold in 1624;
litigation may have prevented their being dealt
with earlier. The lists we have of his MSS. date
from before his foreign tour; that which is in print
was made on the eve of his departure, and contains
a little over 200 entries.</p>

<p>After the vicissitudes which his collection suffered
it is remarkable that one should still be able to
identify as extant well over half of it. I have
been helped in my searches by certain marks&mdash;a
little ladder, or the astrological sign of Jupiter,
or a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Delta">&#916;</ins>&mdash;which occur on the first page of many.
His handwriting, too, in notes, and certain names
of owners (particularly P. Saunders) are guides.
Some of his MSS. were bought by Ussher, and are
at Trinity College, Dublin, and a few were bought
by Cotton. But the largest group of them is at
Corpus Christi College, Oxford. These were acquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><a href="images/85.png">[85]</a></span>
by the great Oxford antiquary, Brian Twyne,
who hoped that his college would buy them from
him, but this they would not do. Happily Twyne
was not too much hurt by the refusal to leave them
to the college at his death. I guess that one reason
for his buying them was that some (perhaps many)
of them had once belonged to his grandfather,
John Twyne, a Canterbury man of some slight
eminence, who in his turn had secured a considerable
"lot" of MSS. from the library of St. Augustine's
Abbey. In searching out the relics of that
great library I found the combination, or pedigree,
St. Augustine's&mdash;John Twyne&mdash;Dee&mdash;Brian Twyne&mdash;Corpus
Christi, to be a frequent one, and this
set me upon a general investigation of Dee's
MSS. A little notebook of his at Corpus Christi
showed that in early life he had borrowed a number
of MSS. from Peterhouse and from Queen's College,
Oxford. I did not find that these ever got back
to their sources, but I do not think that Dee was
dishonest in the matter; I believe he was allowed
to keep them for some consideration received.
Some of the Peterhouse books are traceable in the
Ashmole collection, the Pepys Library, and the
British Museum; of those of Queen's College I can
say nothing. Dee was specially interested in
mathematics, alchemy, and, as everyone knows,
converse with spirits, but his library was not confined
to books on these subjects; he had some excellent
historical, literary, and theological MSS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><a href="images/86.png">[86]</a></span>
One of them was the best copy of Alfred's translation
of Orosius.</p>

<p>Another library of the sixteenth century deserves
to be singled out from the many which offer themselves
for notice. It is that of Lord Lumley
(d. 1609); he inherited the books from Henry
Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel (d. 1580). This collection
had again been largely recruited from that of
Archbishop Cranmer: the combination T(hom&aelig;)
C(ranmeri) C(antuar)&mdash;Arundel&mdash;Lumley, is often
found written on the lower margin of the first leaf
of the MSS. concerned. These Arundel MSS., by
the way, must not be confounded with the Arundel
collection in the British Museum, nor with that
remnant of the same collection which is owned by
the College of Arms. The Arundel MSS., so-called,
were collected largely by Lord William Howard
(Belted Will) of Naworth, passed on to Thomas,
Earl of Arundel (d. 1644), and devised by Henry
Howard to the Royal Society, 1681; they were
eventually transferred by the Society to the British
Museum in 1831. The Arundel-Lumley books had
a different destiny. Most of them also came to the
Museum, but by another path. They were bought
after Lumley's death by or for Prince Henry,
eldest son of James I., and added to the Royal
Library, and that became national property by the
gift of George II. in 1757. We have a catalogue,
made about 1609, of the whole library, which is
among the Gale MSS. at Trinity College, Cambridge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><a href="images/87.png">[87]</a></span>
It bears no name of owner, but is easily seen to be
Lumley's. Not all the MSS. that we find bearing
Lumley's name are in it, and not all the MSS. in it
are in the old Royal Library. To the second class
belong the English Bible at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, the Bible
of Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester (a fine but plain
book which is at Cheltenham in the Phillipps collection),
and the Bosworth Psalter bought not long
ago from a private owner by the British Museum.
The first class is more numerous; about twenty MSS.
at Lambeth alone have Lumley's name, but are
not in his catalogue. I conjecture that they were
presented by Lumley (who was a generous giver
of printed books to the Universities) to Archbishop
Bancroft when he was forming his collection.</p>

<p>So one might go on through Ussher, Laud, Selden,
Rawlinson, Harley, Askew, Drury, Heber, etc., to
Sir Thomas Phillipps, whose 30,000 MSS., good and
bad, must be the largest mass of such things ever
owned by a single collector. But I think I have
said enough of the public and private accumulations
of this country to give an adequate idea of the kind
of results that attend research, and of the ways in
which large blocks of MSS. have been handed on
to us. The epoch of the sale-room I have not
really touched; it demands special tools and a
special historian, and it concerns individual books.
Nor, I will confess, do I feel quite at ease in touching
upon the private collections of the present day.
There is less objection to surveying such things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><a href="images/88.png">[88]</a></span>
when they have passed as wholes into public
institutions.</p>

<p>For example, the MSS. collected by the Earl of
Crawford and Balcarres were acquired in 1892 for
the John Rylands Library at Manchester. The
Latin section of these I have had occasion to
examine. It consists of nearly 120 items. The
earliest and most remarkable of these almost all
own the pedigree of Libri-Bateman-Crawford.
Of Libri enough has been said to make it necessary
to note here that none of the Crawford MSS. owned
by him were pilfered from French libraries. The
library of Bateman of Youlgrave was dispersed
in 1893; the Libri purchases in it are mostly
traceable in the Libri sale catalogue of 1859. Three
tenth-century Spanish MSS., two from the Abbey of
S. Pedro de Carde&ntilde;a, one from Silos, happen, by
an odd and lucky accident, to be elaborately
described in Berganza's <i>Espa&ntilde;a Sagrada</i>; how it
was that exactly these books came into Libri's
hands it is not likely that we shall discover. For
the rest, Lord Crawford's purchases at the Howell
Wills sale of 1894 were considerable in quantity,
and he acquired three fine books at that of Ambroise
Firmin Didot in 1878. Three others came
from the Bollandist Fathers' Library at Brussels.
One of these had for some years formed part of
the very choice collection of the Fountaines at
Narford, in Norfolk, scattered in 1894.</p>

<p>Of less choice quality, but of extreme usefulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><a href="images/89.png">[89]</a></span>
to the student, are the 200 MSS. bequeathed by
Frank McClean in 1904 to the Fitzwilliam Museum
at Cambridge, and collected by him in the ten or
fifteen years before that. Here we have few coherent
groups of books, unless we reckon as such a certain
number of volumes from the Cistercian Abbey of
Morimund in North Italy, acquired singly, perhaps,
by Mr. McClean from Hoepli of Milan. The
Phillipps sales account for a good many, the
Barrois and Ashburnham Appendix (1901 and 1897)
for a few more, but most of the books were picked
up one by one in auction-rooms or from dealers'
catalogues.</p>

<p>In both these cases examples of illumination and
calligraphy have been primary objects in the
collectors' eyes, and that is the ruling passion with
most of those who buy MSS. nowadays. At the
beginning of the nineteenth century what was more
coveted was the accumulation of copies of the
classics. It had hardly been realized that few of
the Renaissance classical MSS. made in Italy have
independent textual value, and collectors like
Askew, Drury, Canonici, Burney, thought that the
more of them they had the better. Lord Fitzwilliam
(d. 1816), who devoted himself to buying
French Books of Hours for the sake of the pictures,
was something of a pioneer (at least in England) in
this respect. Francis Douce (d. 1834) was another;
his treasures are in the Bodleian. As for Sir
Thomas Phillipps, he must have bought by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><a href="images/90.png">[90]</a></span>
cart-load: <i>Nihil manu scriptum a se alienum
putabat</i>. In spite of the large amount of rubbish
among his 30,000 odd volumes, I can never hear
without a bitter pang the tale that the University
of Oxford many years ago shied at his offer of them,
accompanied as it was by some tiresome conditions;
their fate has been gradual dispersion to every
part of Europe and to America.</p>

<p>I have said that I cannot embark here upon the
history of sales of MSS. in the last hundred years.
But my abstention, due to considerations of space,
must not be imitated by my readers. Those who
deal with modern collections or make collections
of their own&mdash;a thing still possible for quite modest
purses, in spite of the inflated prices which the great
books command&mdash;are not absolved from the study
of sale catalogues; that they will pay attention to
book-plates, bindings, and names of owners, I
need not repeat. The list of such catalogues issued
by the British Museum they will find invaluable;
the catalogues themselves, alike those of dealers
and of sales, will often enable them to trace a
particular MS. back through a whole century to
some Italian palace or Flemish abbey, sold up or
secularized under the stress of revolution. This
period of MS. history has been less well worked
than the earlier ones; it is but just ripening, in
fact; but to anyone who is bitten with the passion
for the books it will prove just as fascinating as
the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><a href="images/91.png">[91]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>Curiosities of Research</span></h3>

<p>By way of conclusion let me come back from
generalities to particulars, and attempt to kindle
interest and stir the imagination by a few words
on waifs and strays&mdash;the curiosities of MS. research.
Some few leading instances have been mentioned,
but in thinking over the collections I have examined
and the documents I have had to copy or edit, others,
less immediately showy, occur to my memory.</p>

<p>What has become of the Red Book of Eye in
Suffolk? It was a copy of the Gospels which St.
Felix of Burgundy, the apostle of the East Angles,
brought with him in the seventh century. It
was after his death in a monastery at Dunwich.
Then it passed to a little priory at Eye, where Leland
saw it. After the Dissolution it remained with
the Corporation of Eye&mdash;now extinct&mdash;and people
took oaths upon it. It is traceable in the records
down to a comparatively late date&mdash;within the
nineteenth century. Can there be truth in the
tale I have heard that it was sent for safe keeping
to a mansion not far off, and there cut up for game
labels? I cannot believe it.</p>

<p>No doubt MSS. were cut up for game labels. I have
seen&mdash;years ago&mdash;in a London shop one that had
turned up in a billiard-room, and its blank margins
had been many of them removed for that purpose.
But there was a fashion equally reprehensible a
hundred years ago of cutting out illuminations from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><a href="images/92.png">[92]</a></span>
MSS. and making scrap-books of them. It was
especially common in the case of the great antiphoners
and other huge service-books which stood
on the lecterns in Italian churches. The remainder
of the books went to the gold-beaters, perhaps
(they used parchment, and in England bought
MSS. sometimes to cut up), or to a like destination.
Occasionally books so mutilated have been reconstituted.
A leading example is that of a Josephus,
illuminated in part by the great Tours artist Jean
Foucquet. This the late King Edward VII. and
Mr. H. Y. Thompson were able to combine in
restoring. The King had a number of the pictures,
cut out, in his library at Windsor; Mr. Thompson
had the mutilated text and a pictured leaf or so.
The fragments were brought together and presented
to the Paris Library, which already possessed
the first volume of the set.</p>

<p>A miniature, cut, no one knows how long ago,
from a fine twelfth-century Bible, was shaken out
of a pile of printed copies of a funeral sermon at
a country house. The book to which it belonged
I believe to be one at Lambeth.</p>

<p>In 1890 Mr. Samuel Sandars bought at a London
sale a scrap-book containing two leaves of a beautiful
and very early Book of Hours. He gave them
to the Fitzwilliam Museum. In 1894 came the
Fountaine sale, and then Mr. William Morris
bought the MS. from which these leaves had come.
An arrangement was made between him and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><a href="images/93.png">[93]</a></span>
museum that he should possess the leaves, replaced
in the book, for his life, and then the museum
should acquire the whole at an agreed price. Alas!
he did not live to enjoy the ownership of them long.</p>

<p>To find, as the late Mr. Greenwell of Durham
found, a leaf of a sixth-century Latin Bible from
Wearmouth or Jarrow (or perhaps even from
Cassiodorus's library) in a curiosity shop, is a chance
that comes to few. But I have always lamented
that I did not pass through the streets of Orl&eacute;ans
at the time (not many years back) when an illustrated
Greek MS. of the Gospels on purple vellum
and in gold and silver uncials was exposed for
sale in a shop window. A French officer had picked
it up at Sinope, and used it to keep dried plants in.
However, it went to its rightful and proper home,
the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale.</p>

<p>It is getting on for thirty years now since a small
parish library in Suffolk, founded in 1700, gave
to the world the book of the Gospels owned by St.
Margaret of Scotland (at Oxford), and the unique
life of St. William, the boy martyr of Norwich,
and Nicholas Roscarrock's Register of British
Saints (both at Cambridge). Not as long since,
in a private library in Italy, some leaves were found
of the early MS. (from Hersfeld Abbey in Germany)
of the minor writings of Tacitus from which all our
extant fifteenth-century copies descend. Still more
recently, among a collection of scraps of MSS.,
a half leaf of an eleventh or twelfth century MS.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><a href="images/94.png">[94]</a></span>
in Welsh was detected (a very great rarity); its
generous finder (the late Mr. A. G. W. Murray,
librarian of Trinity College) gave it to the Cambridge
University Library, and thus added one more to the
already remarkable collection of bits of early Welsh
which Cambridge owns. It deals with the dry topic
of finding Easter, but linguistically it is above price.</p>

<p>And now for an example which shows the odd
wanderings of <i>texts</i>. There is a volume at Vienna,
from Bobbio, made up of palimpsest leaves from
many MSS., Biblical and classical. Two of these,
apparently from one book, stand next to each
other. They have only recently been deciphered;
they are in Latin uncials of the fifth century.
One of them is from the Apocalypse of Thomas,
a book named in an old list of Apocryphal writings,
but thought until a few years ago to be hopelessly
lost. We now know complete MSS. of it at Munich
and a fragment at Verona, as well as an Anglo-Saxon
version in the Vercelli MS. The other Vienna
leaf is from an equally apocryphal "epistle of the
Apostles," never mentioned by old writers, but
seemingly of the second century. It gives a
dialogue between our Lord and the Apostles after
the Resurrection. About 1897 Dr. Carl Schmidt,
a leading Coptic scholar, published an account of a
Coptic MS. of the greater part of the book (the MS.
is at Berlin, and some time will be edited); and about
1913 a French scholar, Abb&eacute; Guerrier, published
a complete version of it from Ethiopic MSS. which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><a href="images/95.png">[95]</a></span>
had been in Europe for half a century. It is about
the last book I should have expected to find in a
Latin version, and current in Italy in the fifth
century. The combination of Egypt and Abyssinia
is common enough; but that Bobbio should be
added to that, and Asia Minor and Greece omitted,
is indeed a strange thing. Perhaps Africa was the
parent of the Latin version.</p>


<h3><br /><span class='smallcap'>The Moral</span></h3>

<p>So texts and books wander, and so do discoveries
sometimes lie near our hands. The moral is:
Be inquisitive. See books for yourself; do not
trust that the cataloguer has told you everything.
I am a cataloguer myself, and I know that, try as
he may, a worker of that class cannot hope to know
or to see every detail that is of importance. The
creature is human, and on some days his mind
is less alert than on others. Nor is he interested
in everything alike: an apocryphal fragment or an
obscure saint will excite me, while a letter of
St. Bernard which may be unpublished leaves me
calm. But in spite of the imperfections of cataloguers,
catalogues must be used, and they must
be read and not only referred to. The mere
juxtaposition of treatises in a volume will often
reveal its provenance or its pedigree; besides,
there is always the chance I have suggested, that
the describer of any MS. may have failed through
ignorance or want of attention to see that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><a href="images/96.png">[96]</a></span>
article in it is of extreme interest and rarity. So
it was that in reading Lambecius's (eighteenth-century)
catalogue of the Greek MSS. at Vienna
I noted down an entry that seemed unusual;
and some years after, when I had an opportunity
of getting a friend at Vienna to look at the tract
in question, it was found to be the unique copy of
the very most heretical (and therefore interesting)
episode of the apocryphal Acts of St. John, written
in the second century, and copied, to our lasting
astonishment and perplexity, by some honest
orthodox cleric in the fourteenth.</p>

<p>May discoveries infinitely more pleasing fall
to the lot of many of my patient readers!</p>
